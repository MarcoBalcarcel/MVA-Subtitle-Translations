2
00:00:17,483 --> 00:00:20,466
Welcome back, everyone, to implementing a data

3
00:00:21,183 --> 00:00:24,466
warehouse with SQL server 2012 Jumpstart.

4
00:00:25,483 --> 00:00:29,400
I'm George Squillace, notice S-q-l is in the name. And I'm here

5
00:00:29,483 --> 00:00:32,466
with Rich Currey. Rich, you like to cook, and curry is in your name.

6
00:00:33,483 --> 00:00:36,466
>> It's a spicy combination, I will tell you that.

7
00:00:37,233 --> 00:00:40,466
>> So what's up for this module, Rich? Our final segment of the day.

8
00:00:40,483 --> 00:00:44,466
>> Yep. And this one kind of deviates a little bit from what we've

9
00:00:44,483 --> 00:00:49,466
been talking about right along. However, it is completely, completely

10
00:00:49,483 --> 00:00:54,466
appropriate in this discussion because it's talking about enterprise data.

11
00:00:54,483 --> 00:00:59,466
Now, enterprise data, as you are well aware, George, is the lifeblood

12
00:01:00,483 --> 00:01:01,466
of a company.

13
00:01:02,333 --> 00:01:05,466
So what we're going to be talking about in this module is two

14
00:01:06,483 --> 00:01:13,200
relative new pieces of SQL Server, Master Data Services and Data

15
00:01:13,283 --> 00:01:14,466
Quality Services.

16
00:01:15,483 --> 00:01:18,466
Now, Master Data Services is...

17
00:01:19,483 --> 00:01:24,350
first came in with SQL Server 2008. We were going to give you

18
00:01:24,433 --> 00:01:28,466
an overview of what it's all about, talk about the data models

19
00:01:28,483 --> 00:01:33,466
and entities and attributes, hierarchies, business rules.

20
00:01:33,483 --> 00:01:35,266
>> Lots of moving parts.

21
00:01:35,350 --> 00:01:39,466
>> Yeah. There are lots of moving parts. So Master Data Services

22
00:01:39,483 --> 00:01:45,466
is the SQL Server solution that was developed enterprise-level data.

23
00:01:45,483 --> 00:01:49,466
Now, we talked about and I had a slide up way back at the beginning

24
00:01:49,483 --> 00:01:56,466
of this today that talked about the fact that data needs to be

25
00:01:56,483 --> 00:02:01,466
matched from different systems. We have lots of operational systems

26
00:02:01,483 --> 00:02:07,466
that consume the same data, and it is a really good idea to have

27
00:02:07,483 --> 00:02:11,466
a single source. Because, let's face, it, if I'm a customer in

28
00:02:11,483 --> 00:02:17,0
an organization and I'm a customer of, say, three different subsidiaries

29
00:02:17,483 --> 00:02:21,466
of that company, that means that I might have registered as a

30
00:02:21,483 --> 00:02:27,466
customer three separate times. Maybe I used Rich Currey one time,

31
00:02:27,216 --> 00:02:30,466
Richard Currey one time, and R.

32
00:02:30,483 --> 00:02:35,466
Currey one time, each of those is me, but because I put my name

33
00:02:35,483 --> 00:02:36,466
in differently,

34
00:02:37,483 --> 00:02:42,466
the systems think I'm three different people. So Master Data

35
00:02:42,483 --> 00:02:46,383
Services allows me to create a single source

36
00:02:47,483 --> 00:02:48,466
for all...

37
00:02:49,416 --> 00:02:54,466
for the information that's used by multiple solutions within

38
00:02:54,483 --> 00:02:55,466
the enterprise.

39
00:02:56,483 --> 00:03:00,466
It allows an organization do centralized storage of data rather

40
00:03:00,483 --> 00:03:06,233
than distributed storage. It allows us to create a single spot

41
00:03:06,316 --> 00:03:09,466
for a data steward to go clean things up.

42
00:03:09,483 --> 00:03:10,466
>> A data steward?

43
00:03:10,483 --> 00:03:13,466
>> A data steward. We talked about him earlier today.

44
00:03:14,333 --> 00:03:20,466
And we also now have a single spot for ETL to go to take and

45
00:03:20,483 --> 00:03:24,466
get all of those... all of that information distributed to the

46
00:03:24,483 --> 00:03:29,466
systems that need to consume it. Now, Master Data Services uses

47
00:03:29,483 --> 00:03:36,466
data models and business rules to not just define but also manage

48
00:03:36,483 --> 00:03:39,466
the correctness or validity of the data.

49
00:03:40,266 --> 00:03:44,166
Now, a data model is a container, George. It is a container

50
00:03:44,483 --> 00:03:50,466
that has entities in it. Now, an entity is a real-world thing.

51
00:03:51,483 --> 00:03:55,466
The data in a data model represents all of the entities.

52
00:03:55,483 --> 00:04:01,466
So, for example, a product could be an entity. A customer could

53
00:04:01,483 --> 00:04:02,466
be an entity.

54
00:04:03,483 --> 00:04:08,466
A supplier could be an entity. A shipper. All of those entities

55
00:04:09,483 --> 00:04:10,466
have attributes.

56
00:04:11,483 --> 00:04:14,466
Attributes are the pieces of information that describe them,

57
00:04:14,483 --> 00:04:19,466
just like in a dimension, George. A dimension has attributes

58
00:04:19,483 --> 00:04:24,216
that are used to describe the entities there. So I create entities,

59
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:25,466
I create attributes.

60
00:04:26,483 --> 00:04:30,466
Then I have the ability to create hierarchies. Hierarchies express

61
00:04:30,483 --> 00:04:33,466
the relationships between entities.

62
00:04:34,483 --> 00:04:37,466
Now, you might be...

63
00:04:38,483 --> 00:04:40,466
you might be templed to

64
00:04:42,283 --> 00:04:46,466
create one big data model. Nah. Don't to that.

65
00:04:47,483 --> 00:04:53,466
Create smaller data models that are purposed to a specific part

66
00:04:53,483 --> 00:04:55,166
of the business.

67
00:04:55,483 --> 00:05:01,466
Don't try and do one size fits all; do different pieces that

68
00:05:01,483 --> 00:05:06,466
are purposed specifically to the part of the information that

69
00:05:06,483 --> 00:05:07,466
they're covering.

70
00:05:07,483 --> 00:05:09,466
>> So I have to create a data model.

71
00:05:09,483 --> 00:05:10,200
>> You do.

72
00:05:10,283 --> 00:05:14,400
>> And I want to compartmentalize using some sort of rule book.

73
00:05:14,416 --> 00:05:14,433
>> Yep.

74
00:05:14,450 --> 00:05:14,466
>> Okay.

75
00:05:14,483 --> 00:05:18,466
>> I may have, for example, a customers data model, a products

76
00:05:18,483 --> 00:05:21,466
data model, a suppliers data model.

77
00:05:22,483 --> 00:05:26,466
Each one is going to have all of the entities, all of the hierarchies,

78
00:05:26,483 --> 00:05:32,466
all of the business rules necessary to validate what is going

79
00:05:32,483 --> 00:05:34,333
on with the data.

80
00:05:34,483 --> 00:05:38,166
>> An honest question here, Rich. So if I have multiple systems

81
00:05:38,483 --> 00:05:41,466
that might have product data, I might create a products model.

82
00:05:42,0 --> 00:05:44,466
If I had multiple systems that had customer data, I might create

83
00:05:45,166 --> 00:05:46,333
a customer model.

84
00:05:46,416 --> 00:05:50,466
>> Absolutely. And it doesn't even have to be multiple systems.

85
00:05:50,483 --> 00:05:54,466
You can create a data model to control the information in a single

86
00:05:54,483 --> 00:06:00,466
system with the thought that there might be more systems coming later.

87
00:06:00,483 --> 00:06:02,166
>> Aha. So set it up ahead of time.

88
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:05,433
>> Absolutely. Plan to succeed.

89
00:06:05,450 --> 00:06:05,466
>> All right.

90
00:06:05,483 --> 00:06:08,383
>> And then you will succeed when you plan.

91
00:06:08,450 --> 00:06:08,466
>> All right.

92
00:06:09,483 --> 00:06:16,466
>> Anyway. So a data model contains both entities and attributes.

93
00:06:17,466 --> 00:06:22,466
The entity represents a business object, a logical business object

94
00:06:22,483 --> 00:06:27,466
like a customer, like a supplier, like a product, that can be

95
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:32,466
consumed in one or more systems. And each entity has multiple

96
00:06:32,483 --> 00:06:36,466
attributes, the pieces of information that describe that entity.

97
00:06:36,483 --> 00:06:40,466
It might be, for a customer, first name, last name, address,

98
00:06:40,483 --> 00:06:45,466
e-mail, city, region, postal code. There could be a bunch of them.

99
00:06:45,483 --> 00:06:50,466
And then the collection, each entity has members. You could

100
00:06:50,483 --> 00:06:55,300
be a customer. I could be a customer. Danny could a customer.

101
00:06:55,383 --> 00:06:57,433
Even Alise could be a customer.

102
00:06:58,483 --> 00:06:59,466
>> Woohoo.

103
00:06:59,166 --> 00:07:01,466
>> You know, the peanut gallery likes it when they get included

104
00:07:01,483 --> 00:07:04,466
in the broadcast, so I had to do it.

105
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:04,466
>> There you go.

106
00:07:05,483 --> 00:07:09,466
>> Now, each of those members has to have values assigned for

107
00:07:09,483 --> 00:07:14,466
each of the attributes that represent that entity. Now, when

108
00:07:14,483 --> 00:07:17,466
you're designing it, George, each entity is typically going to

109
00:07:17,483 --> 00:07:22,466
map to tables in RDBMSs and the attributes are going to map to

110
00:07:22,483 --> 00:07:26,466
the column. So if I've got five different systems that each use

111
00:07:26,483 --> 00:07:30,466
product data, I'm going to create a product entity and I want

112
00:07:30,483 --> 00:07:36,466
to make sure that I define an attribute for every column that

113
00:07:36,483 --> 00:07:38,466
exists in every table.

114
00:07:39,483 --> 00:07:43,466
It doesn't mean that I'm going to have the product name five times.

115
00:07:44,483 --> 00:07:48,466
I'm going to make sure that I have an attribute for name and

116
00:07:48,483 --> 00:07:53,466
it appears in all five systems so I have a single source for

117
00:07:53,483 --> 00:07:54,466
that attribute value.

118
00:07:54,483 --> 00:07:56,466
>> Master data.

119
00:07:56,216 --> 00:08:01,466
>> You got it. And then the members will map to the individual

120
00:08:02,216 --> 00:08:04,466
records in each table.

121
00:08:05,416 --> 00:08:10,466
Now, next step is relationships between those entities.

122
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:14,433
And typically that's going to be the same thing as setting up

123
00:08:14,483 --> 00:08:20,466
foreign key relationships. The analogy holds true. It is a parent-child relationship.

124
00:08:21,483 --> 00:08:26,466
Hierarchies represent either the relationship between entities

125
00:08:26,483 --> 00:08:30,466
themselves or between individual members of entities.

126
00:08:31,483 --> 00:08:34,466
And that kind of falls into the difference between a derived

127
00:08:34,483 --> 00:08:40,466
hierarchy and an explicit hierarchy. A derived hierarchy is

128
00:08:40,483 --> 00:08:46,466
one that is determined by the relationship between entities.

129
00:08:46,483 --> 00:08:52,400
You can look at it and say, hey, guess what, this category relates

130
00:08:52,483 --> 00:08:57,466
to these products. There is a way to derive the relationship.

131
00:08:58,333 --> 00:09:00,466
It's based on attribute values.

132
00:09:01,483 --> 00:09:06,466
An explicit hierarchy is one that you're putting together.

133
00:09:06,483 --> 00:09:13,466
For example, maybe I have continents like North America and Europe

134
00:09:13,483 --> 00:09:16,466
and I've got countries to map to it, but I don't necessarily

135
00:09:16,483 --> 00:09:20,466
have a continent in my databases.

136
00:09:21,483 --> 00:09:25,183
I don't have an attribute called continent that it would make

137
00:09:25,266 --> 00:09:26,316
sense to build.

138
00:09:26,483 --> 00:09:32,466
So what I do is I create a... what's called a consolidated member

139
00:09:32,483 --> 00:09:36,466
and I give it a name, such as what you see here on the slide,

140
00:09:37,483 --> 00:09:42,466
with the consolidated member code cust US, consolidated member

141
00:09:42,483 --> 00:09:43,466
code cust EU.

142
00:09:44,483 --> 00:09:49,466
Now, when you've got explicit hierarchies, you also have the

143
00:09:49,483 --> 00:09:55,466
ability to specify whether they are mandatory hierarchies or

144
00:09:55,483 --> 00:10:01,466
whether they are not. A mandatory hierarchy is one where all

145
00:10:01,483 --> 00:10:08,466
members of that entity must be assigned to one of the consolidated members.

146
00:10:08,483 --> 00:10:14,166
If it is nonmandatory, then they don't need to be. So, for example,

147
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:18,466
if all I wanted for consolidated member, George, was the U.S.

148
00:10:18,483 --> 00:10:21,466
and my European customers and the rest of the world I was going

149
00:10:22,0 --> 00:10:26,466
let them go and just say, you know, they're not a part of the U.S.

150
00:10:26,483 --> 00:10:32,466
or European customer groups, that would be a nonmandatory hierarchy.

151
00:10:33,483 --> 00:10:40,466
If I then created a consolidated member called all others where

152
00:10:40,183 --> 00:10:44,466
my U.S. customers were in one, my European in another, and then

153
00:10:44,483 --> 00:10:48,466
everybody else was assigned to all other, I could then make that

154
00:10:48,483 --> 00:10:49,466
a mandatory hierarchy.

155
00:10:50,483 --> 00:10:52,183
>> And you have some things to show us now.

156
00:10:52,266 --> 00:10:57,466
>> I do. I do. We are going to drop over to our virtual machine

157
00:10:57,483 --> 00:11:01,466
now, and the first thing we're going to do is... I got to tell

158
00:11:01,483 --> 00:11:02,466
you, George.

159
00:11:02,483 --> 00:11:03,466
>> What's that?

160
00:11:03,483 --> 00:11:08,466
>> You're not going to find Master Data Services in SQL Server

161
00:11:08,483 --> 00:11:09,466
Management Studio.

162
00:11:09,483 --> 00:11:10,466
>> Different management tool?

163
00:11:10,483 --> 00:11:15,466
>> It is. It is. And it's one of our favorite ones.

164
00:11:16,483 --> 00:11:18,466
Internet Explorer.

165
00:11:18,483 --> 00:11:20,466
>> Browser-based admin.

166
00:11:20,483 --> 00:11:25,233
>> You got it. It means no installing tools on the desktop.

167
00:11:25,483 --> 00:11:29,466
And there are advantages to that, although not necessarily a

168
00:11:29,483 --> 00:11:34,466
lot of them. I'm going to set my browser to .2, the installed

169
00:11:34,483 --> 00:11:40,166
instance, and you're going to configure this when you install

170
00:11:40,483 --> 00:11:44,216
Master Data Services on your network. I'm going to local host

171
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:46,466
port 81/MDS, and

172
00:11:47,483 --> 00:11:51,466
that brings up the homepage for Master Data Services.

173
00:11:51,483 --> 00:11:52,466
>> There you go.

174
00:11:52,483 --> 00:11:55,466
>> Let me get it scrolled over so you can actually see the whole thing.

175
00:11:56,483 --> 00:12:00,466
Now, the first thing that I want to do is I want to go into system

176
00:12:00,483 --> 00:12:05,466
administration because I have not yet created a model.

177
00:12:05,483 --> 00:12:10,466
So I am going to create a model. Notice I'm in add model.

178
00:12:11,433 --> 00:12:13,466
I'm going to call that model customers.

179
00:12:14,266 --> 00:12:17,466
>> Just for a sec, could you slide your VM title bar over a little

180
00:12:17,483 --> 00:12:20,383
to the right? It looks like that's being clipped at the left.

181
00:12:20,450 --> 00:12:20,466
>> It's not.

182
00:12:21,166 --> 00:12:22,200
>> It's not? Okay.

183
00:12:22,283 --> 00:12:22,466
>> No.

184
00:12:22,483 --> 00:12:23,466
>> All right.

185
00:12:24,483 --> 00:12:27,466
>> Yeah. I'm fully all the way over.

186
00:12:27,483 --> 00:12:28,250
>> Okay.

187
00:12:28,333 --> 00:12:30,466
>> Let's see.

188
00:12:30,483 --> 00:12:31,466
>> There you go. Perfect.

189
00:12:32,450 --> 00:12:32,466
>> Okay.

190
00:12:32,483 --> 00:12:33,266
>> That's it.

191
00:12:33,350 --> 00:12:35,466
>> Yeah. Screen looks like it's getting clipped there. Sorry about

192
00:12:35,483 --> 00:12:36,466
that, folks.

193
00:12:37,183 --> 00:12:41,466
So what I'm going to do now is I'm not going to create an entity

194
00:12:41,483 --> 00:12:44,466
at this point because I'm going to go and do that at a later point.

195
00:12:44,483 --> 00:12:49,466
When I save it, my model is now in there with the name of customers.

196
00:12:49,483 --> 00:12:54,466
It shows up with metadata. I'm next going to go to manage and

197
00:12:54,483 --> 00:12:55,466
choose entities.

198
00:12:56,483 --> 00:13:00,466
First thing I need to do is choose the correct model. So I'm

199
00:13:00,483 --> 00:13:06,416
in model, and now I add an entity. The entity I'm going to put

200
00:13:06,483 --> 00:13:08,466
in there is customers.

201
00:13:10,283 --> 00:13:15,466
I can assign a staging table for that entity. I can create code values.

202
00:13:16,483 --> 00:13:20,466
I can enable explicit hierarchies and connections. That's what

203
00:13:20,483 --> 00:13:21,450
you do here.

204
00:13:23,483 --> 00:13:28,316
My choice here, I am going to not enable them.

205
00:13:29,483 --> 00:13:32,466
I add my entity in by saving it.

206
00:13:36,483 --> 00:13:38,466
And now I have my customers.

207
00:13:39,483 --> 00:13:41,466
And notice over here

208
00:13:43,383 --> 00:13:44,466
my entities.

209
00:13:44,483 --> 00:13:45,466
>> There you go.

210
00:13:47,166 --> 00:13:49,466
>> Now what I'm going to do is I'm going to head back over

211
00:13:51,483 --> 00:13:59,416
and I need to now add in hierarchy. I need to add in attributes.

212
00:14:00,433 --> 00:14:05,166
So back to system, manage...

213
00:14:05,483 --> 00:14:07,466
I clicked too quick. Sorry about that.

214
00:14:09,433 --> 00:14:10,466
Manage entities.

215
00:14:12,483 --> 00:14:16,466
I choose my customer entity and notice I now get a new set of

216
00:14:16,483 --> 00:14:17,466
buttons up here.

217
00:14:18,483 --> 00:14:21,466
As I choose that, one of my buttons

218
00:14:23,483 --> 00:14:30,466
is to edit the selected entity. And when I do, now I get my leaf members.

219
00:14:31,350 --> 00:14:33,466
Another word for attributes.

220
00:14:34,483 --> 00:14:37,466
>> And I don't know about you, Rich, but I think it's going to

221
00:14:37,483 --> 00:14:40,466
take people that are new to this to get a little... it's going

222
00:14:41,483 --> 00:14:43,466
to take some time to the user interface.

223
00:14:43,483 --> 00:14:49,466
>> Yeah. I absolutely agree with that. This is one of those things

224
00:14:49,483 --> 00:14:53,466
where practice is going to make you better and better. Now, I

225
00:14:53,483 --> 00:14:57,400
know George brought that up because I searched for a moment there

226
00:14:57,483 --> 00:15:00,466
because I went back to the homepage and I didn't need to, because

227
00:15:00,483 --> 00:15:03,466
honestly I forget where it was for a second.

228
00:15:03,483 --> 00:15:07,466
>> Actually, that's not why. I'm not contradicting; I found that

229
00:15:07,183 --> 00:15:08,466
I had to wrestle with it a lot.

230
00:15:08,483 --> 00:15:11,466
>> Oh, yeah. I wrestled with it all the time. And sometimes I

231
00:15:12,166 --> 00:15:16,466
still wrestle with that interface. So now that I've got my entity

232
00:15:16,483 --> 00:15:21,466
set up, I've got my leaf members displaying, I'm going to add

233
00:15:21,483 --> 00:15:25,466
in a new leaf attribute. I give it a name. Now, because it's

234
00:15:25,483 --> 00:15:31,350
a customer, guess what, we can put in a city, and that is going

235
00:15:31,433 --> 00:15:36,300
to be text with a length of we'll say 400.

236
00:15:37,183 --> 00:15:43,466
And when I'm done I hit save. It brings me back. I can add in

237
00:15:43,483 --> 00:15:48,466
another leaf on this one, maybe I'll do phone.

238
00:15:49,483 --> 00:15:54,466
And on phone I'm going to do a data type of text with a length

239
00:15:54,483 --> 00:15:56,466
of call it 20 characters.

240
00:15:57,483 --> 00:16:00,333
I save it. And what do you say we do one more, George?

241
00:16:00,416 --> 00:16:01,216
>> Let's do one more.

242
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:04,466
>> All right. I'm going to put in credit limit.

243
00:16:05,483 --> 00:16:11,450
Credit limit is going to be a number that's going to be zero

244
00:16:12,350 --> 00:16:16,466
decimals, and now I choose my input mask which tells me how I'm

245
00:16:16,483 --> 00:16:19,166
going to represent negative values.

246
00:16:19,483 --> 00:16:23,466
Now, I'm just going to choose the minus sign here. I save it.

247
00:16:24,483 --> 00:16:28,466
And now I have a list of columns

248
00:16:30,233 --> 00:16:31,466
for my table.

249
00:16:32,233 --> 00:16:33,383
>> Have your attributes.

250
00:16:33,466 --> 00:16:36,466
>> Or attributes for my entities. Cool?

251
00:16:37,450 --> 00:16:37,466
>> Cool.

252
00:16:38,450 --> 00:16:38,466
>> All right.

253
00:16:38,483 --> 00:16:39,466
>> We're underway.

254
00:16:39,483 --> 00:16:43,466
>> We are. So what's next on our journey?

255
00:16:43,483 --> 00:16:45,466
>> Next up, business rules.

256
00:16:47,483 --> 00:16:53,466
>> Mmm. Because, let's face it, Master Data is nothing if it isn't correct.

257
00:16:55,166 --> 00:17:00,416
The biggest myth in IT: My data's clean. You want to hear a

258
00:17:00,450 --> 00:17:00,466
story, George?

259
00:17:00,483 --> 00:17:03,466
>> I would. And you have a bunch of good ones.

260
00:17:03,483 --> 00:17:07,266
>> I do. But I've got one in particular that I want to do here,

261
00:17:07,350 --> 00:17:13,466
because I did a project back in my professional days for a multinational,

262
00:17:13,483 --> 00:17:18,450
well-known, very large corporation with lots of subsidiaries,

263
00:17:18,483 --> 00:17:22,466
and it was a business IntelliSense project that was going to

264
00:17:22,483 --> 00:17:28,266
do business analysis to do projections for future business.

265
00:17:28,350 --> 00:17:33,416
Forecasting. It was about a 14-month project. We spent the first

266
00:17:33,483 --> 00:17:38,416
two months of the project working on the design of the hierarchies

267
00:17:38,483 --> 00:17:42,350
and the dimensions. I say that because it is probably one of

268
00:17:42,433 --> 00:17:47,466
the most critical points. We then spent the next seven months...

269
00:17:48,483 --> 00:17:49,466
>> Did you say seven?...

270
00:17:49,483 --> 00:17:54,466
>> trying to take data from all of these different systems and

271
00:17:54,483 --> 00:18:00,466
get it so that it all correlated and was usable. There were

272
00:18:00,483 --> 00:18:04,466
mismatches, there was bad information, there was no cleansing

273
00:18:04,483 --> 00:18:09,0
done, so we had to do all of the analysis of the data itself

274
00:18:09,483 --> 00:18:13,466
and build the cleansing. Master Data would have been a huge help

275
00:18:13,483 --> 00:18:18,466
to make that happen, to create that centralized spot that we

276
00:18:18,483 --> 00:18:21,466
could have then driven everything out to. Just to give you an

277
00:18:22,333 --> 00:18:26,466
idea of how complex the cleansing was, the project lasted for

278
00:18:26,483 --> 00:18:31,466
about five more months and we did six rollouts of functionality

279
00:18:31,483 --> 00:18:36,466
in the five months compared to seven months of doing nothing

280
00:18:36,483 --> 00:18:40,466
but data cleansing. So that's the level of effort that Master

281
00:18:40,483 --> 00:18:42,466
Data Services will provide.

282
00:18:42,483 --> 00:18:46,466
So going on back to the slide for a minute, we are going to be

283
00:18:47,483 --> 00:18:50,466
talking about the business rules because they're what ensures

284
00:18:50,483 --> 00:18:55,466
that data is valid and correct. Now, valid is one thing.

285
00:18:55,483 --> 00:19:00,200
Validation happens at many levels in a database in an application.

286
00:19:00,483 --> 00:19:04,466
Correct, however, is something else entirely. Because correct

287
00:19:04,483 --> 00:19:10,466
has meaning, it has substance behind it, about determining whether

288
00:19:10,483 --> 00:19:17,466
a value is the appropriate value for the entity being tracked.

289
00:19:17,483 --> 00:19:22,383
Now, you set up the business rules in MDS and then you can use

290
00:19:22,466 --> 00:19:27,466
either the MDS Web interface or, you're going to love this, for

291
00:19:27,483 --> 00:19:31,333
our data stewards who maybe are not as technically inclined as

292
00:19:31,483 --> 00:19:37,466
some of us IT folks, you can also use Microsoft Excel as a front-end plug-in.

293
00:19:38,483 --> 00:19:40,350
>> A new plug-in that came with 2012.

294
00:19:40,433 --> 00:19:43,466
>> It is. So let's go take a look at a business rule real quick.

295
00:19:43,483 --> 00:19:48,466
We are going to bounce back into our virtual machine and we are

296
00:19:48,483 --> 00:19:51,466
going to go back to our models.

297
00:19:51,483 --> 00:19:56,466
I'm going to choose my customers model and now...

298
00:19:57,483 --> 00:20:00,466
oh, I take it back. I'm going to go back to entities, my apologies,

299
00:20:01,483 --> 00:20:06,466
and when I choose the customer entity, I now have my business rules.

300
00:20:07,483 --> 00:20:13,466
So in my business rules, this is where I'm going to derive what

301
00:20:14,483 --> 00:20:21,466
the validation policy is for specific records. So I create a

302
00:20:21,483 --> 00:20:28,466
new business rule. This business rule is going to be check valid...

303
00:20:30,483 --> 00:20:34,466
typing is a challenge at times when you have fingers as big as mine...

304
00:20:34,483 --> 00:20:37,466
valid credit limit.

305
00:20:38,483 --> 00:20:45,300
Okay. I've now named it and I go into expression and in this

306
00:20:45,383 --> 00:20:48,250
expression I'm now going to define

307
00:20:49,483 --> 00:20:53,466
what it is I want to do. So I edit my selected business rule.

308
00:20:54,483 --> 00:21:01,233
Now, this is not exactly the most intuitive thing you've ever

309
00:21:01,316 --> 00:21:02,316
seen, is it?

310
00:21:02,483 --> 00:21:04,466
>> That's well stated, Rich.

311
00:21:04,483 --> 00:21:09,216
>> Okay. So there's a couple of pieces here. The if qualifies

312
00:21:09,483 --> 00:21:17,250
when I'm going to look at a particular entity.

313
00:21:17,483 --> 00:21:21,466
So I can say if this is true, then apply the rule.

314
00:21:22,483 --> 00:21:25,466
If it's not true, then don't apply the rule.

315
00:21:26,483 --> 00:21:30,466
In here I'm going to grab an action and my action is going to

316
00:21:30,483 --> 00:21:35,466
be must be greater than.

317
00:21:36,483 --> 00:21:39,466
I'm going to drop that under my actions.

318
00:21:41,483 --> 00:21:49,166
Now I have no condition, so then everything must be greater than.

319
00:21:49,483 --> 00:21:51,466
If I wanted to grab, for example,

320
00:21:54,483 --> 00:22:00,466
is equal to, I could say if, for example, customer type equals

321
00:22:01,266 --> 00:22:04,466
X, then must be greater than,

322
00:22:05,483 --> 00:22:08,466
and then down here I choose my attribute,

323
00:22:10,483 --> 00:22:15,466
my attribute value that I want in there, so the first thing I

324
00:22:15,483 --> 00:22:20,316
need to do is grab the attribute that I want. It is the credit limit.

325
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:23,466
I drop it onto my attribute.

326
00:22:25,483 --> 00:22:26,466
The value

327
00:22:29,483 --> 00:22:31,466
must be greater than...

328
00:22:31,483 --> 00:22:34,466
mmm, come on there.

329
00:22:35,483 --> 00:22:37,466
Oh, I'm sorry. I put that in the wrong spot.

330
00:22:37,483 --> 00:22:40,466
>> Exactly what I was talking about.

331
00:22:40,233 --> 00:22:43,466
>> Yep. This is where it gets funky. So now I got to start all

332
00:22:43,483 --> 00:22:47,250
over again because I had to delete it. It's not easy to get it.

333
00:22:47,333 --> 00:22:50,466
So I'm going to drop the must be greater than.

334
00:22:51,233 --> 00:22:55,466
I'm going to drop my credit limit into select attribute this time.

335
00:22:55,483 --> 00:22:58,466
>> Before you drop, though, look at right where you're going to

336
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:01,466
let go, it says select attribute. And then below and to the

337
00:23:01,483 --> 00:23:05,433
right it says the same thing, but they don't do the same thing.

338
00:23:05,450 --> 00:23:05,466
Argh.

339
00:23:05,483 --> 00:23:10,466
>> Absolutely correct. And that's why I got it messed up the first time.

340
00:23:10,166 --> 00:23:14,466
Because what I'm trying to do is say that the credit limit must

341
00:23:14,483 --> 00:23:19,466
be greater than so it reads top to bottom. And now I'm going

342
00:23:19,483 --> 00:23:23,466
to assign a specific value and say credit limit must be greater

343
00:23:23,483 --> 00:23:25,316
than 500.

344
00:23:26,483 --> 00:23:32,266
I save it. My business rule is now in place, and you can see

345
00:23:32,350 --> 00:23:38,333
credit limit must be greater than 500. It is unconditional.

346
00:23:38,450 --> 00:23:38,466
Cool, George?

347
00:23:38,483 --> 00:23:39,466
>> Cool.

348
00:23:39,483 --> 00:23:43,466
>> All right. So now let's go back and very quickly, what we want

349
00:23:43,483 --> 00:23:49,166
to do now, is we're going to go back to our homepage and now

350
00:23:49,250 --> 00:23:53,166
we're going to go to Explorer because Explorer is where we can

351
00:23:53,483 --> 00:23:56,316
actually manually enter some data.

352
00:23:56,483 --> 00:24:00,466
Now, there's two ways to populate a model. You can use standard

353
00:24:00,483 --> 00:24:04,466
ETL because it's tables in a database. So you just take data

354
00:24:05,0 --> 00:24:09,466
from point A to point B. Or if you've got some specific ones,

355
00:24:09,483 --> 00:24:13,466
I can add a member. Now, I clicked on add member, it brings all

356
00:24:14,333 --> 00:24:17,383
the details over here. And I can say Rich,

357
00:24:19,483 --> 00:24:22,466
the city, I am currently in...

358
00:24:25,383 --> 00:24:27,300
yeah, I can spell, huh?

359
00:24:29,250 --> 00:24:31,466
There we go. That's better. A phone

360
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:36,466
and a credit limit.

361
00:24:39,483 --> 00:24:44,466
I got a credit limit of 5,000. I'm a good customer. I'm going

362
00:24:44,483 --> 00:24:48,366
to say that this is an original entry.

363
00:24:50,450 --> 00:24:50,466
I hit okay.

364
00:24:52,483 --> 00:24:54,466
Code value cannot be blank.

365
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:57,466
I'll put in a code value of 1.

366
00:24:57,483 --> 00:24:59,433
>> Good object lesson there.

367
00:24:59,450 --> 00:24:59,466
>> Oh, yeah.

368
00:25:00,483 --> 00:25:04,466
>> And now Rich is in there, a code of 1, Seattle.

369
00:25:06,483 --> 00:25:11,466
I'm going to go back in. I'm now going to change this from 5,000

370
00:25:11,483 --> 00:25:13,466
to 500 and hit okay.

371
00:25:13,483 --> 00:25:15,466
>> Still valid.

372
00:25:15,483 --> 00:25:19,466
>> Still valid. If I change it down to 50...

373
00:25:20,483 --> 00:25:25,466
still valid. That shouldn't have worked.

374
00:25:25,483 --> 00:25:27,183
>> Nope, that should not have worked.

375
00:25:27,266 --> 00:25:30,466
>> All right. So I guess we got a little troubleshooting to do.

376
00:25:30,166 --> 00:25:32,466
Ah. What did I not do?

377
00:25:33,483 --> 00:25:35,466
I did not apply the rules.

378
00:25:36,483 --> 00:25:38,466
>> So let's see what happens.

379
00:25:39,483 --> 00:25:41,333
>> Business rules will be applied.

380
00:25:41,416 --> 00:25:47,433
Yes. I think what I forgot is to deploy the rules. So let's

381
00:25:47,450 --> 00:25:47,466
go back.

382
00:25:48,483 --> 00:25:51,466
Let's go back to our system admin because you know what I didn't

383
00:25:52,483 --> 00:25:58,466
do, I think once I got to my business rules I did not save it.

384
00:25:58,483 --> 00:26:02,466
So manage entities, manage, business rules.

385
00:26:03,483 --> 00:26:06,0
Yep, I did not publish.

386
00:26:06,416 --> 00:26:07,400
>> There you go.

387
00:26:07,483 --> 00:26:10,466
>> You got to remember to publish the rule, George.

388
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:14,466
Now that I've published it, we're going to go back. Notice the

389
00:26:14,483 --> 00:26:16,466
status is now active.

390
00:26:17,0 --> 00:26:21,466
When we come back through here, we're going to go to Explorer.

391
00:26:21,483 --> 00:26:24,466
Notice I have a member in here. See the question?

392
00:26:24,483 --> 00:26:25,466
>> Well, what do you know?

393
00:26:25,483 --> 00:26:29,466
>> It's waiting for re-evaluation. So now if I apply the rule,

394
00:26:29,483 --> 00:26:34,466
I've got an exclamation next to it, it tells me that validation failed.

395
00:26:34,483 --> 00:26:35,466
>> That's right.

396
00:26:35,483 --> 00:26:39,466
>> If I come over, notice the validation errors. If I now change

397
00:26:39,483 --> 00:26:46,466
this to 501 and hit okay, it immediately evaluates and gives

398
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:47,466
me a green check.

399
00:26:47,483 --> 00:26:48,466
>> Good tool.

400
00:26:48,483 --> 00:26:52,466
>> It is. It's a very, very, very cool tool.

401
00:26:53,483 --> 00:26:56,433
There's a lot more that you can do with it. Trust me, George.

402
00:26:56,450 --> 00:26:56,466
>> Wow.

403
00:26:56,483 --> 00:26:58,466
>> There is a ton of stuff.

404
00:26:59,483 --> 00:27:02,466
>> Now, what about those circumstances where I don't feel like

405
00:27:02,483 --> 00:27:06,466
manually entering in all of those entities

406
00:27:08,283 --> 00:27:11,466
into the Master Data Services form there? Is there any way we

407
00:27:11,483 --> 00:27:13,466
can improve our efficiency?

408
00:27:14,483 --> 00:27:17,466
>> Absolutely. Just a little bit. I mean, let's face it, most

409
00:27:17,483 --> 00:27:20,466
times you're going to have lots of business systems already in

410
00:27:20,483 --> 00:27:26,166
place when you're implemented MDS. So consuming Master Data

411
00:27:26,250 --> 00:27:28,416
is all about setting up

412
00:27:29,483 --> 00:27:34,466
hooks between all of your systems. You've got a hub and spoke architecture.

413
00:27:35,483 --> 00:27:40,466
You've got the Master Data Services as the central hub of your

414
00:27:40,483 --> 00:27:46,466
solution and it then goes out to all of the different systems,

415
00:27:46,483 --> 00:27:52,466
all of the different databases and using SSIS can now manage

416
00:27:52,483 --> 00:27:57,466
the movement of the data from enterprise out to operational,

417
00:27:57,483 --> 00:28:01,466
from operational back into the enterprise. With MDS you can

418
00:28:01,483 --> 00:28:06,283
do your validation and cleansing, you can use that cleansed data

419
00:28:06,366 --> 00:28:10,466
then to update the operational systems. Cool?

420
00:28:10,483 --> 00:28:15,466
>> Very cool. So we have another part of having trustworthy and

421
00:28:15,483 --> 00:28:17,466
cleansed data. And what's up next?

422
00:28:17,483 --> 00:28:23,466
>> Data Quality Services is the next part of this enterprise data solution.

423
00:28:24,483 --> 00:28:30,466
And Data Quality Services is, again, relatively new to SQL Server.

424
00:28:30,483 --> 00:28:34,466
It is available in 2008 and 2012.

425
00:28:36,166 --> 00:28:39,466
We're going to show you how to build the solution, how to access

426
00:28:39,483 --> 00:28:43,466
reference data or talk about reference data. We're going to

427
00:28:43,483 --> 00:28:49,466
talk about data validation using DQS and show you a little bit

428
00:28:49,483 --> 00:28:50,466
with SSIS.

429
00:28:50,483 --> 00:28:55,383
>> And I do want to give a test-taking tip, and that is if you're

430
00:28:55,466 --> 00:28:58,250
planning on passing the certification exam, you're going to want

431
00:28:58,333 --> 00:29:03,466
to have some hands-on time with both MDS and DQS. You can download

432
00:29:03,483 --> 00:29:05,466
trial versions of the software to help you get there.

433
00:29:05,483 --> 00:29:09,466
>> And I agree with George. It's one of those that I would highly,

434
00:29:09,483 --> 00:29:14,466
highly recommend that you go out and play with it. It's out there.

435
00:29:14,483 --> 00:29:15,466
It's good.

436
00:29:16,450 --> 00:29:19,466
Well, like we've been talking right along, data is the lifeblood

437
00:29:20,450 --> 00:29:25,450
of an organization. Incorrect data lead to incorrect analysis

438
00:29:25,483 --> 00:29:29,366
which leads to incorrect decision-making which leads to, for

439
00:29:29,450 --> 00:29:31,466
many businesses, bankruptcy.

440
00:29:32,383 --> 00:29:37,466
So really and truly it is in our best interest to make sure that

441
00:29:37,483 --> 00:29:44,0
that data is accurate and correct. Data Quality Services implements

442
00:29:44,450 --> 00:29:50,350
the tools that do that for us. It gives us access to a knowledge base.

443
00:29:50,433 --> 00:29:54,466
A knowledge base can contain information that's used to validate

444
00:29:55,483 --> 00:30:01,466
our organizational data, not as a source of our organizational data.

445
00:30:01,483 --> 00:30:06,466
And that's the big difference between MDS and DQS.

446
00:30:07,483 --> 00:30:09,466
MDS is the source of enterprise information,

447
00:30:11,216 --> 00:30:17,200
DQS allows us to correct that information and make it good.

448
00:30:17,483 --> 00:30:22,466
We have what are called reference data services that provide

449
00:30:22,483 --> 00:30:28,450
that ability to access data. Now, the first thing you need to

450
00:30:28,483 --> 00:30:32,466
do when you're creating a solution is to create a knowledge base.

451
00:30:32,483 --> 00:30:38,466
The knowledge base provides access to specific areas of information.

452
00:30:38,483 --> 00:30:42,466
A knowledge base can have multiple pieces of information, it

453
00:30:42,483 --> 00:30:46,466
can have a single piece of information, and inside of that knowledge

454
00:30:46,483 --> 00:30:48,466
base you create domains.

455
00:30:49,166 --> 00:30:56,466
Domains house the rules that are applied, the way that you can

456
00:30:56,483 --> 00:30:57,466
correct data.

457
00:30:58,483 --> 00:31:02,466
So once you've got your domain, which is the responsibility of

458
00:31:02,483 --> 00:31:06,400
data, you define the rules that are going to relate to whether

459
00:31:06,483 --> 00:31:11,466
a value is correct or incorrect, valid or invalid, and you can

460
00:31:11,483 --> 00:31:16,466
even set up matching rules, George, to fix all those typos that happen.

461
00:31:16,483 --> 00:31:17,466
>> There you go.

462
00:31:17,483 --> 00:31:22,200
>> I know I can't type to save my life, so if I'm typing wholesaler,

463
00:31:22,283 --> 00:31:23,466
I may get w-h-i-l

464
00:31:25,483 --> 00:31:30,466
stead of o-l because it hit the wrong key. So matching policies

465
00:31:30,483 --> 00:31:34,466
allow me to take values and figure out how they go together.

466
00:31:35,483 --> 00:31:36,466
We ready?

467
00:31:36,483 --> 00:31:37,283
>> We're ready.

468
00:31:37,366 --> 00:31:41,416
>> All right. Let's see what we can do with this one.

469
00:31:41,483 --> 00:31:46,466
>> So in the same way MDS requires some base object setup, DQS

470
00:31:46,483 --> 00:31:48,466
is going to require some base object setup as well.

471
00:31:49,0 --> 00:31:52,466
>> It is. Now, unlike MDS,

472
00:31:53,483 --> 00:32:00,466
DQS is a client tool. The DQS client is accessible from the SQL

473
00:32:00,483 --> 00:32:06,366
Server group of tools in the start menu.

474
00:32:06,450 --> 00:32:07,466
>> Start menu access.

475
00:32:07,483 --> 00:32:12,466
>> Here is Data Quality Services. Here is my Data Quality client

476
00:32:12,166 --> 00:32:13,466
that gives me access.

477
00:32:14,483 --> 00:32:17,466
Now, the first thing you need to do, George, is connect to the

478
00:32:17,483 --> 00:32:21,166
server that's got all the information, which in this case is

479
00:32:21,250 --> 00:32:24,183
Miami-SQL BI.

480
00:32:24,266 --> 00:32:24,466
>> There you go.

481
00:32:25,483 --> 00:32:28,466
>> Now, I just want to show you something really quick. I'm going

482
00:32:28,216 --> 00:32:28,466
to go into...

483
00:32:29,483 --> 00:32:33,466
well, I hate it when it does that. I am going to go into management

484
00:32:33,483 --> 00:32:35,466
studio and I'm going to display databases.

485
00:32:36,466 --> 00:32:37,466
>> Oh, I see something there.

486
00:32:38,483 --> 00:32:42,466
>> DQS main, DQS projects, DQS data.

487
00:32:43,300 --> 00:32:47,466
There's an MDS database. So I am going to tell you, it ain't free.

488
00:32:47,483 --> 00:32:49,466
It's never free.

489
00:32:50,483 --> 00:32:55,466
But it is well worth the price of admission. So the first thing

490
00:32:55,483 --> 00:32:59,466
I need to do in this process is to create a knowledge base.

491
00:32:59,483 --> 00:33:03,466
So my knowledge base, I am going to create a

492
00:33:04,483 --> 00:33:09,466
DQS demo knowledge base and I am going to

493
00:33:11,483 --> 00:33:15,466
create it from an existing knowledge base called DGS data.

494
00:33:16,483 --> 00:33:22,466
Now, it shows me the domains that are available, so I need to

495
00:33:22,483 --> 00:33:27,466
go to next in the wizard because I'm going to do domain management.

496
00:33:28,483 --> 00:33:35,466
It now brings me to the next page, which is where I am going

497
00:33:35,483 --> 00:33:36,466
to select

498
00:33:38,483 --> 00:33:42,466
the domains that I want in my database. Notice there is a bunch

499
00:33:43,483 --> 00:33:44,466
of them listed.

500
00:33:44,483 --> 00:33:48,466
>> It's nice the product comes with one knowledge base that you

501
00:33:48,233 --> 00:33:50,466
can work with, and it's some address-related data.

502
00:33:50,483 --> 00:33:54,466
>> It is. So the first thing I need to do is I am going to be

503
00:33:54,483 --> 00:34:00,466
focusing in on the U.S. state domain. Now, that means I want

504
00:34:00,483 --> 00:34:04,466
to get rid of all these others. So you highlight it, you click

505
00:34:04,483 --> 00:34:06,466
the X, you say yes.

506
00:34:06,483 --> 00:34:09,466
>> And I don't think there's a trick for multiselecting that I found.

507
00:34:09,483 --> 00:34:15,466
>> Unfortunately, George, you better hope you don't have 300 domains.

508
00:34:15,483 --> 00:34:20,466
You only want ten of them. Because you've got to do this for

509
00:34:20,483 --> 00:34:26,0
every domain that you don't want to use. So while I'm clicking

510
00:34:26,483 --> 00:34:31,400
and waiting, we need to keep talking so these folks don't get

511
00:34:31,483 --> 00:34:35,466
bored out of their mind watching me get rid of the extraneous information.

512
00:34:35,483 --> 00:34:37,466
>> All right. While you're mentioning that, here's one rule of

513
00:34:37,483 --> 00:34:42,466
thumb that helped me divide between where MDS helps and where

514
00:34:42,483 --> 00:34:47,466
DQS helps. In fact, with DQS you want to think of having correct

515
00:34:47,483 --> 00:34:52,283
column values. Whereas with MDS... and, again, this is broad,

516
00:34:52,366 --> 00:34:55,466
big picture. And with MDS, you want to make sure that you have

517
00:34:55,483 --> 00:34:59,466
correct rows when you might have different rows from different systems.

518
00:34:59,483 --> 00:35:03,466
I can different rows from different systems that are all valid,

519
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:06,466
they are correct data, but one I want to be the winning row,

520
00:35:06,483 --> 00:35:10,466
the master. So for whatever that's worth, let's go back to the demo.

521
00:35:10,483 --> 00:35:14,466
>> You got it. And that's actually a great piece of advice, George.

522
00:35:14,483 --> 00:35:16,316
>> I think it got it from somewhere else.

523
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:18,466
>> Well, hey, you remembered it. That's a good thing.

524
00:35:18,483 --> 00:35:19,466
>> All right.

525
00:35:19,483 --> 00:35:22,466
>> All right. So I'm going to change the domain name here from U.S.

526
00:35:22,483 --> 00:35:27,166
state to just state. I've gotten rid of all the others. And now

527
00:35:27,483 --> 00:35:30,466
what I want to do is go over to domain values. Because, guess

528
00:35:30,483 --> 00:35:35,466
what, there are already some prepopulated values in there.

529
00:35:35,483 --> 00:35:40,466
So you can see the state name and you can see some pretty common

530
00:35:40,483 --> 00:35:42,466
occurrences that might show up.

531
00:35:43,483 --> 00:35:48,466
AL is correct. But we're going to correct it too Alabama.

532
00:35:50,216 --> 00:35:55,166
ALA period is not a correct value, it's an error value, but it's

533
00:35:55,250 --> 00:35:57,466
still going to be corrected to Alabama.

534
00:35:57,483 --> 00:36:01,466
>> So if I see ALA show up in my data, I can set up a rule that

535
00:36:01,483 --> 00:36:04,466
says force it into becoming Alabama.

536
00:36:04,483 --> 00:36:09,466
>> That is exactly correct. So this is just an example of some

537
00:36:10,333 --> 00:36:12,466
of the things you've got. I'm going to finish her off now.

538
00:36:13,483 --> 00:36:17,166
When I finish building in the knowledge base, then it asks me

539
00:36:17,250 --> 00:36:20,466
if I want to publish it. For now I'm going to say no. We're going

540
00:36:20,483 --> 00:36:22,466
to hold off on that. Okay?

541
00:36:22,483 --> 00:36:23,433
>> Sounds good.

542
00:36:23,450 --> 00:36:23,466
>> All right.

543
00:36:24,483 --> 00:36:29,466
>> And how would an IT person, a BI developer like myself, possibly

544
00:36:29,483 --> 00:36:32,466
know what typically invalid values will be?

545
00:36:32,483 --> 00:36:35,466
>> Well, you're going to have to have some business knowledge,

546
00:36:35,483 --> 00:36:42,466
number one. But, number two, there are... out in the Azure marketplace

547
00:36:43,483 --> 00:36:48,466
there are publically available databases that you can bring into

548
00:36:48,483 --> 00:36:51,466
Data Quality Services as a source of information.

549
00:36:52,483 --> 00:36:55,316
Some of those are subscription cost.

550
00:36:55,483 --> 00:37:00,366
Some of them are subscription free of charge. It depends, but

551
00:37:00,450 --> 00:37:05,216
they are available out there. Many of them are public domain

552
00:37:05,300 --> 00:37:10,466
and freely available. Others you might need to contact a representative

553
00:37:10,483 --> 00:37:13,466
to get it. But that's called reference data.

554
00:37:14,483 --> 00:37:18,466
All of that is referred to as reference data. And that's what

555
00:37:18,483 --> 00:37:25,250
you set up as the source that you're going to use to get some

556
00:37:25,333 --> 00:37:29,466
of this information. So if I need a listing of all the cities

557
00:37:29,483 --> 00:37:33,466
in every country in the world, yeah, that would be kind of tough

558
00:37:33,483 --> 00:37:34,466
to type in. Don't you think?

559
00:37:34,483 --> 00:37:37,466
>> Yeah, you don't have that in your back pocket already.

560
00:37:37,483 --> 00:37:41,466
>> Nope. So nicely enough there is probably a database out there.

561
00:37:41,483 --> 00:37:45,466
I don't know for sure. But there is probably a database out there

562
00:37:45,483 --> 00:37:49,466
that lists every country, its valid abbreviations, and every

563
00:37:49,483 --> 00:37:56,466
city as well with valid spellings. Now, when you're going in

564
00:37:56,483 --> 00:38:02,466
and setting up these projects, you need to do data validation.

565
00:38:02,483 --> 00:38:06,466
And that's called a data cleansing project. The data cleansing

566
00:38:06,483 --> 00:38:12,266
project is what gives our data stewards the ability to analyze

567
00:38:12,483 --> 00:38:18,466
data in a database and manage the validity and correctness of it.

568
00:38:18,483 --> 00:38:22,466
So you've got a knowledge base and you've got a data source.

569
00:38:23,483 --> 00:38:26,450
The knowledge base we just talked about, the reference data.

570
00:38:26,483 --> 00:38:30,466
The data source is the data that I want to check. Cleansing can

571
00:38:30,483 --> 00:38:35,466
include validation, making sure values are correct. It can also

572
00:38:35,216 --> 00:38:41,466
include matching, finding records that actually mean the same thing.

573
00:38:41,483 --> 00:38:46,233
And it can do both at the same time. Now, here's the nice thing.

574
00:38:46,483 --> 00:38:52,400
It is not assumed that just because DQS says it's right means

575
00:38:52,483 --> 00:38:58,466
it's right. It does output, as a result of the cleansing process,

576
00:38:59,483 --> 00:39:02,466
the records that have been affected as well as what the effects

577
00:39:03,0 --> 00:39:08,466
were, showing you original values and corrected values.

578
00:39:08,483 --> 00:39:11,466
>> Some great IntelliSense that it provides there.

579
00:39:11,483 --> 00:39:15,466
>> Absolutely, George. So let's go take a look at a data cleansing

580
00:39:15,483 --> 00:39:20,466
project and what it does. So in my virtual machine, what I need

581
00:39:20,483 --> 00:39:26,466
to do now is access a new data quality project. So just like

582
00:39:26,483 --> 00:39:30,466
before I need to give it a name. In my name I'm going to just

583
00:39:30,483 --> 00:39:31,466
call this,

584
00:39:33,450 --> 00:39:34,466
really inventive here,

585
00:39:36,333 --> 00:39:37,400
cleanse project.

586
00:39:38,483 --> 00:39:41,400
It's late. I can't think of any good names anymore, George.

587
00:39:41,483 --> 00:39:42,466
>> That's a great name.

588
00:39:42,483 --> 00:39:49,466
>> The knowledge base that I'm going to use is DQS data.

589
00:39:51,0 --> 00:39:53,466
Now it's a wizard.

590
00:39:54,483 --> 00:39:58,300
I choose my cleansing project. I say next.

591
00:39:59,450 --> 00:39:59,466
>> Next.

592
00:40:01,483 --> 00:40:02,466
>> And we wait.

593
00:40:02,483 --> 00:40:03,466
>> You said say next.

594
00:40:04,483 --> 00:40:07,466
>> Yeah, but I said I say next. So be quiet.

595
00:40:08,483 --> 00:40:09,400
Oh, lord.

596
00:40:09,483 --> 00:40:15,466
So now I've got my data source. My data source here is going

597
00:40:15,483 --> 00:40:21,466
to be an Excel file. So I have... I just happen to have out

598
00:40:21,483 --> 00:40:28,466
here, George, at the tip of my fingers a stores.xls spreadsheet

599
00:40:29,466 --> 00:40:31,466
which contains a bunch of information.

600
00:40:33,483 --> 00:40:38,466
Now, what I need to do now is map things in. I've got a city.

601
00:40:39,483 --> 00:40:41,466
The city is going to map to...

602
00:40:42,483 --> 00:40:47,466
and I don't have city in here. So I think what I'll do is I'm

603
00:40:47,483 --> 00:40:51,466
going to add a column mapping. Okay. I'm going to...

604
00:40:52,483 --> 00:40:57,466
oh, I'm sorry. What am I doing here? I'm going to validate that state.

605
00:40:58,483 --> 00:40:59,333
>> There you go.

606
00:40:59,483 --> 00:41:00,366
>> Been a long day, hasn't it?

607
00:41:00,450 --> 00:41:00,466
>> Long day.

608
00:41:00,483 --> 00:41:06,466
>> And I'm going to map it to the U.S. state. So my source column,

609
00:41:06,483 --> 00:41:13,466
my domain, now I go in and I go to the next step in the process

610
00:41:13,483 --> 00:41:16,466
which is the analysis of the two.

611
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:24,466
I run my analysis. It takes the inputs and it uploads in and

612
00:41:24,483 --> 00:41:25,466
it processes.

613
00:41:26,483 --> 00:41:31,466
As it processes, it's going through, it cleanses the records.

614
00:41:32,483 --> 00:41:37,316
And it's showing me statistics about those cleanses. So how

615
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:40,466
many were correct, how many were incorrect, et cetera. Now, this

616
00:41:40,483 --> 00:41:43,316
one is running for a while here.

617
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:43,466
>> Curious.

618
00:41:44,483 --> 00:41:48,233
>> It is, because it typically runs much quicker than this.

619
00:41:50,483 --> 00:41:54,466
>> What do we have, 11 whole rows in the stores spreadsheet I think?

620
00:41:54,483 --> 00:41:55,466
>> Yeah.

621
00:41:55,483 --> 00:41:57,316
>> Whatever, not a whole lot. And there you go.

622
00:41:57,400 --> 00:42:00,233
>> Okay. We got preprocessing done.

623
00:42:00,316 --> 00:42:00,466
>> Preprocessing done.

624
00:42:01,483 --> 00:42:05,466
>> And there we go. Now we got our cleansing done. And it shows

625
00:42:05,483 --> 00:42:10,466
you there were nine correct records. There were two corrected records.

626
00:42:10,483 --> 00:42:17,366
When I go to the next step, I can see suggesteds, new, invalid.

627
00:42:17,450 --> 00:42:22,466
I can see the corrected records. You can see CA and WA were

628
00:42:22,483 --> 00:42:26,466
corrected to California and Washington.

629
00:42:26,483 --> 00:42:27,233
>> Did what we told it to do.

630
00:42:27,316 --> 00:42:32,200
>> And here are the ones that were valid and what their values were.

631
00:42:32,483 --> 00:42:33,466
Pretty cool, huh?

632
00:42:34,450 --> 00:42:34,466
>> Beautiful.

633
00:42:35,316 --> 00:42:36,466
>> All right.

634
00:42:36,483 --> 00:42:38,466
So headed back to the sides.

635
00:42:39,416 --> 00:42:41,466
We have next...

636
00:42:42,483 --> 00:42:44,466
>> Validating data with SSIS.

637
00:42:44,483 --> 00:42:47,466
So... well, I have to let you tell the story.

638
00:42:47,483 --> 00:42:48,466
>> No, no, no, no, no. Please.

639
00:42:48,483 --> 00:42:52,466
>> Well, rather than having such a manual process of validating

640
00:42:52,483 --> 00:42:56,166
data, maybe we want to raise the bar a bit.

641
00:42:56,483 --> 00:42:57,433
>> Automate it.

642
00:42:57,450 --> 00:42:57,466
>> Automate.

643
00:42:58,483 --> 00:43:04,466
>> Because as good dBAs, I want to have all the things that happen...

644
00:43:04,483 --> 00:43:10,466
that happen repetitively be automated and take all of that manual

645
00:43:10,483 --> 00:43:12,466
labor out of the process. So I've got

646
00:43:14,483 --> 00:43:21,166
validating tools using a data source and data cleansing project

647
00:43:21,483 --> 00:43:26,466
and then a data cleansing transform, which can take and do the

648
00:43:26,483 --> 00:43:31,466
exact same thing that I just did manually. You need to have

649
00:43:31,483 --> 00:43:36,466
data destinations to hold the cleansed data, and you need to...

650
00:43:36,483 --> 00:43:41,466
and you can also pipe it through other transformations after

651
00:43:41,483 --> 00:43:42,466
the fact.

652
00:43:42,483 --> 00:43:49,0
Now, SSIS is the best place to do this because now as you're

653
00:43:49,483 --> 00:43:53,466
pulling your data from point A to point B, from source systems

654
00:43:53,483 --> 00:43:58,466
through into destination systems, you can do the cleansing in

655
00:43:58,483 --> 00:44:06,466
transit and end up with clean data with no manual intervention.

656
00:44:07,483 --> 00:44:08,466
You like that?

657
00:44:08,200 --> 00:44:10,466
>> I do. And it looks like you have something to show here.

658
00:44:11,166 --> 00:44:15,466
>> We are going to give this one a shot. Let's head on over.

659
00:44:16,483 --> 00:44:21,466
And I have a knowledge base, I have a cleansing project, so I

660
00:44:21,483 --> 00:44:24,316
am going to close out of

661
00:44:26,333 --> 00:44:30,466
my DQS client.

662
00:44:31,483 --> 00:44:35,350
And now we are going to create... come on.

663
00:44:35,433 --> 00:44:38,466
Where... I'm not at the top. That's why.

664
00:44:38,483 --> 00:44:41,466
>> Your mouse by the Hyper-V buttons has made my hair stand up

665
00:44:41,483 --> 00:44:43,366
on end a couple of times.

666
00:44:44,483 --> 00:44:45,200
>> Yeah.

667
00:44:45,283 --> 00:44:46,466
>> Because if you power those down...

668
00:44:47,350 --> 00:44:51,466
>> Yeah. I've kind of... notice I haven't clicked very often.

669
00:44:51,483 --> 00:44:53,466
>> You haven't. You've been very careful.

670
00:44:53,483 --> 00:44:58,466
>> I got to tell you, I am the king of closing windows accidentally.

671
00:44:58,483 --> 00:45:04,466
I am absolutely flabbergasted that I have not closed that Hyper-V

672
00:45:04,483 --> 00:45:06,466
window once all day.

673
00:45:07,483 --> 00:45:09,466
All right. So let's go back to the virtual machine here.

674
00:45:09,483 --> 00:45:13,166
We're going to do a new project. It's going to be an integration

675
00:45:13,483 --> 00:45:18,316
services project. And very simply what I want to do is show you

676
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:24,466
that DQS transform. So I'm going to drop a dataflow task onto

677
00:45:24,483 --> 00:45:25,466
our designer.

678
00:45:26,250 --> 00:45:27,466
>> Star of the opera.

679
00:45:27,483 --> 00:45:31,466
>> Yep. And then we're going to come over here and we are going

680
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:36,466
to go to DQS cleansing and drop it in place. Now, first thing

681
00:45:36,483 --> 00:45:41,266
is, it has no available input column. So guess what I need to do?

682
00:45:41,350 --> 00:45:42,466
>> That means it's a source.

683
00:45:42,483 --> 00:45:48,466
>> I need to go and grab some data to put into it. So I am going

684
00:45:49,0 --> 00:45:54,466
to create a source, a data source that is going to be an OLE D...

685
00:45:54,483 --> 00:45:57,466
yeah, I'm going to grab a data source, so what do I do, a grab

686
00:45:57,483 --> 00:45:58,466
a destination.

687
00:45:59,483 --> 00:46:03,466
I'm going to grab an OLE DB source, we're going to configure

688
00:46:03,483 --> 00:46:07,266
that source up, we're going to grab a new connection manager

689
00:46:07,483 --> 00:46:11,466
that's going to go out to our demo DQS,

690
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:17,466
and we are going to grab... all right.

691
00:46:17,483 --> 00:46:23,416
Let's create a new connection manager.

692
00:46:23,483 --> 00:46:25,466
>> Or... sorry.

693
00:46:25,483 --> 00:46:30,466
>> No, got to... first... it didn't like the one that I just got.

694
00:46:30,483 --> 00:46:34,466
So I'm going to create a new one that's going to go out to, I

695
00:46:34,483 --> 00:46:38,466
clicked on the arrow... I haven't done that all day either, not once.

696
00:46:38,483 --> 00:46:40,466
>> No, but now we can wait for that to happen.

697
00:46:40,483 --> 00:46:43,466
>> And you know what? I misspoke. The DQS is a transform, so

698
00:46:43,483 --> 00:46:44,466
it's going to have inputs.

699
00:46:44,483 --> 00:46:46,466
>> It is. So I'm going to go out

700
00:46:47,483 --> 00:46:52,166
to MIA-SQL BI. I'm going to go out and I'm going to grab data

701
00:46:52,250 --> 00:46:58,466
from demo DQS. Ah, that's why. I missed a...

702
00:46:59,400 --> 00:47:05,466
I did not run a script that I need to run. So my demo DQ database

703
00:47:05,483 --> 00:47:10,366
isn't in there. So we're going to go back out real quick to management studio.

704
00:47:10,450 --> 00:47:16,383
We are going to run a script that's out there that's going to

705
00:47:16,466 --> 00:47:21,466
create it. I need to go out and grab from

706
00:47:23,400 --> 00:47:24,466
mod 9.

707
00:47:26,450 --> 00:47:26,466
>> Says setup.

708
00:47:29,483 --> 00:47:35,466
>> My setup script. Yep. And there's my demo DQS. We'll execute it.

709
00:47:36,483 --> 00:47:40,316
Now I've got my data. So I should be able to go back in.

710
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:41,466
Sorry about that, folks.

711
00:47:43,0 --> 00:47:44,466
We are going to go back in.

712
00:47:45,483 --> 00:47:50,466
We now have in here, or we should, anyway... I'm going to cancel

713
00:47:50,183 --> 00:47:50,466
it out.

714
00:47:51,483 --> 00:47:54,466
I'm going to choose my demo DQS.

715
00:47:56,383 --> 00:47:56,466
>> Perfect.

716
00:47:56,483 --> 00:47:58,466
>> There's my store's table.

717
00:47:59,483 --> 00:48:03,466
I go to columns. It grabs the columns in the store table.

718
00:48:04,483 --> 00:48:09,433
We now have our data source that we're going to put through the cleansing.

719
00:48:09,450 --> 00:48:09,466
>> Perfect.

720
00:48:09,483 --> 00:48:10,466
>> I connect the two.

721
00:48:11,483 --> 00:48:15,466
Now I go to my DQS cleansing. The first thing it needs to know

722
00:48:15,233 --> 00:48:19,183
is the Data Quality connection manager. I don't have one, so

723
00:48:19,266 --> 00:48:23,466
I'm going to define a new one. It says where is your DQS server.

724
00:48:24,483 --> 00:48:28,466
I'm going to point it to the one I've got on SQL BI, we test

725
00:48:28,483 --> 00:48:30,250
it, we got the right one...

726
00:48:30,333 --> 00:48:30,466
>> That's good....

727
00:48:30,483 --> 00:48:34,316
>> we're good to go. Now, what knowledge base are we going to use?

728
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:35,466
>> Well, we only have one right now, so...

729
00:48:35,483 --> 00:48:40,466
>> That's a good thing. We'll do our DQS data. These are our

730
00:48:40,483 --> 00:48:44,466
available domains. Now I'm going to set up my mapping,

731
00:48:46,333 --> 00:48:50,300
my available input columns. I'm going to choose my state.

732
00:48:51,483 --> 00:48:54,466
The domain that it's going to map to is U.S.

733
00:48:54,483 --> 00:48:58,466
state. I now have my mapping setup.

734
00:48:59,483 --> 00:49:00,466
I can save

735
00:49:01,483 --> 00:49:06,466
my component. At least I can once I get to where the save button is.

736
00:49:08,483 --> 00:49:09,466
There's my okay.

737
00:49:09,483 --> 00:49:10,466
>> Perfect.

738
00:49:10,483 --> 00:49:14,266
>> And now I can take that output and put it somewhere.

739
00:49:14,483 --> 00:49:18,466
We're going to create a flat file destination real quick.

740
00:49:19,483 --> 00:49:20,466
>> Oh, that was a source.

741
00:49:21,416 --> 00:49:23,466
>> Huh. I'm just all over it today, aren't I?

742
00:49:24,166 --> 00:49:24,466
>> Just trying to cover.

743
00:49:24,483 --> 00:49:28,300
>> Here's my destinations. Flat file destination. We're going

744
00:49:28,383 --> 00:49:29,466
to hook the two up.

745
00:49:31,183 --> 00:49:35,250
Define the output. So I'm going to create my connection manager.

746
00:49:35,483 --> 00:49:42,466
It is delimited. It is going to go to the desktop.

747
00:49:42,483 --> 00:49:43,466
>> Excitement's building.

748
00:49:43,483 --> 00:49:47,350
>> It is. I'm getting there. Slowly but surely.

749
00:49:47,483 --> 00:49:52,466
We give it a file name, which is going to be cleansed stores.

750
00:49:52,483 --> 00:49:53,466
>> Nice.

751
00:49:53,483 --> 00:49:57,316
>> .out, .text.

752
00:49:58,483 --> 00:50:04,466
I hit open now. And that destination could be a SQL Server destination

753
00:50:04,483 --> 00:50:07,316
to populate a table if I want it to.

754
00:50:08,383 --> 00:50:12,166
Here are all my columns. Notice the store ID, the name, street,

755
00:50:12,483 --> 00:50:15,466
city, state. I've got state source, state out, state status,

756
00:50:16,483 --> 00:50:19,466
the record status, everything is there.

757
00:50:20,483 --> 00:50:24,166
Now I do my mappings.

758
00:50:25,483 --> 00:50:29,466
That ties it all together. When I execute the package, it reads

759
00:50:32,483 --> 00:50:37,466
the data from the table, runs it through the cleansing output.

760
00:50:38,483 --> 00:50:40,466
Come on, folks, I know you got it.

761
00:50:43,483 --> 00:50:46,466
There we go. It goes through the cleansing.

762
00:50:48,483 --> 00:50:54,466
When the cleansing has completed, it goes out to the flat file

763
00:50:54,483 --> 00:50:57,466
destination where it gets written.

764
00:50:57,216 --> 00:51:02,366
This is taking way too long.

765
00:51:02,450 --> 00:51:03,466
>> It's working, it's working.

766
00:51:04,450 --> 00:51:08,366
>> If I could put more horsepower on this virtual machine, folks,

767
00:51:08,450 --> 00:51:10,466
trust me, I'd put it on there.

768
00:51:11,483 --> 00:51:13,466
But at this point we can only wait, sir.

769
00:51:15,483 --> 00:51:18,466
There we go. We have success.

770
00:51:18,483 --> 00:51:19,466
>> Liftoff.

771
00:51:20,233 --> 00:51:21,466
>> Now I go out to

772
00:51:24,250 --> 00:51:28,466
my desktop. There is cleansed stores. And you can see Store

773
00:51:28,483 --> 00:51:33,466
1, New York, New York, New York. It's correct. California, California.

774
00:51:34,483 --> 00:51:37,466
WA, W-A, Washington is corrected.

775
00:51:38,483 --> 00:51:43,466
And it says it out at the end as well. So, again, that transform

776
00:51:43,483 --> 00:51:49,466
gives you the fully corrected data and you can take it, you're

777
00:51:49,483 --> 00:51:53,466
doing a transform later on, use those corrected values to load

778
00:51:54,483 --> 00:51:56,466
downstream data destinations.

779
00:51:56,483 --> 00:51:59,416
>> All right. Everybody take a deep breath and exhale.

780
00:52:00,483 --> 00:52:02,183
>> Enterprise data.

781
00:52:02,266 --> 00:52:03,466
>> We looked at Master Data Services.

782
00:52:03,483 --> 00:52:04,233
>> We did.

783
00:52:04,316 --> 00:52:05,433
>> Data Quality Services.

784
00:52:05,450 --> 00:52:05,466
>> We did.

785
00:52:05,483 --> 00:52:09,466
>> A whole bunch of things today. And now it's time for a survey.

786
00:52:09,483 --> 00:52:13,466
You'll see a poll down at the very bottom of your screen. A lot

787
00:52:13,483 --> 00:52:17,350
of resources went into making this available today and they're

788
00:52:17,433 --> 00:52:21,466
interested, the powers that be, in getting your feedback. So please...

789
00:52:21,483 --> 00:52:23,333
>> As are we, quite honestly.

790
00:52:23,416 --> 00:52:26,466
>> We are too. Sure. We want to make sure that it was worthwhile

791
00:52:26,483 --> 00:52:30,466
for you. So please take the survey at the bottom. And on behalf

792
00:52:30,483 --> 00:52:34,466
of Rich Currey and myself, George Squillace, thank you for attending.

793
00:52:34,483 --> 00:52:38,466
And we hope to have you come back for some of the other Jumpstarts

794
00:52:38,483 --> 00:52:39,466
that will be available.

795
00:52:39,483 --> 00:52:42,466
>> Absolutely. Keep your eyes out on MVA. Thanks, folks.

796
00:52:42,483 --> 00:52:45,466
Have a great rest of the day wherever you may be.
