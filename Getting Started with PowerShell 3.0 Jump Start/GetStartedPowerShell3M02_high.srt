00:00:00,483 --> 00:00:08,466
[Music]

2
00:00:18,266 --> 00:00:21,466
>> So you ready to do a little Help and help me out and...

3
00:00:21,483 --> 00:00:23,466
>> Yeah, do a little help, help, help?

4
00:00:23,483 --> 00:00:24,466
>> Yeah, yeah.

5
00:00:24,483 --> 00:00:29,466
>> Because guys, this is probably the most important section of

6
00:00:29,483 --> 00:00:32,466
the entire day, and it may not even seem like it at first, but

7
00:00:32,483 --> 00:00:36,466
I swear to God that this is the most important thing. And here's

8
00:00:36,483 --> 00:00:37,466
why it's so important.

9
00:00:38,483 --> 00:00:41,466
When you go to PowerShell, you're going to stare at that console

10
00:00:41,483 --> 00:00:45,433
and go now what do I do? This is the answer.

11
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:45,466
So...

12
00:00:46,483 --> 00:00:49,466
>> Kierkegaard called that the dizziness of freedom. You look

13
00:00:49,483 --> 00:00:52,466
at that prompt and you can do anything. You're like uh, what

14
00:00:52,483 --> 00:00:53,466
do I do?

15
00:00:53,483 --> 00:00:57,300
>> And it is, a lot... it affects all of us. And a lot of us,

16
00:00:57,383 --> 00:01:00,433
you get past that with what we're going to do now.

17
00:01:00,450 --> 00:01:00,466
>> Yeah, exactly.

18
00:01:00,483 --> 00:01:01,466
>> The Help system.

19
00:01:02,483 --> 00:01:06,466
But I think for a lot of folks, I see it all the time, okay,

20
00:01:06,483 --> 00:01:09,466
it made sense when you were doing it, but now I'm staring at

21
00:01:09,483 --> 00:01:13,466
that console and I just don't know what to do. And I don't know

22
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:13,466
where to go.

23
00:01:14,483 --> 00:01:17,466
And they create a solution for you. This is a beautiful solution.

24
00:01:17,483 --> 00:01:20,366
So what we're going to start off with is looking at the Help

25
00:01:20,450 --> 00:01:23,466
system, showing you how to get it updated, and this is actually

26
00:01:23,483 --> 00:01:26,0
a fascinating feature in V3. Remember I was saying you're going

27
00:01:26,483 --> 00:01:28,466
to want to be using V3, and this is going to be one of them.

28
00:01:28,483 --> 00:01:31,466
The most important thing is the discoverability that the Help

29
00:01:31,483 --> 00:01:35,466
system provides you. Basically, it is your... it is your Bing

30
00:01:35,483 --> 00:01:40,466
for PowerShell. It is... it answers all of your needs and all

31
00:01:40,233 --> 00:01:43,466
of your questions. And also, we're going to show you how to read

32
00:01:43,483 --> 00:01:47,333
syntax and so forth. So let's get started with the Help stuff.

33
00:01:47,416 --> 00:01:49,466
And here in about ten minutes we'll take a break and then we'll

34
00:01:49,483 --> 00:01:53,466
come back in and look at all the syntax and start getting into it.

35
00:01:53,216 --> 00:01:57,466
So first of all, why you need Help. Well, I just want to go

36
00:01:57,483 --> 00:01:58,466
to bullet number two.

37
00:01:59,483 --> 00:02:00,466
>> Exactly.

38
00:02:00,483 --> 00:02:06,400
>> Can we talk about this? I'm a smart guy, but I'm not smart

39
00:02:06,483 --> 00:02:07,466
enough to just know everything.

40
00:02:07,483 --> 00:02:08,466
>> Absolutely.

41
00:02:08,483 --> 00:02:10,466
>> So tell me what the idea here is.

42
00:02:10,483 --> 00:02:13,466
>> Yeah, so one of my jokes, although it's actually true, that

43
00:02:13,483 --> 00:02:16,466
is PowerShell is such a great product because I'm such a deeply

44
00:02:16,483 --> 00:02:17,466
flawed human.

45
00:02:20,483 --> 00:02:23,283
It's true. I'm a deeply flawed human, and I was in a position

46
00:02:23,366 --> 00:02:26,433
to say, hey, let's build a tool that helps me, right?

47
00:02:26,450 --> 00:02:26,466
>> Right.

48
00:02:26,483 --> 00:02:30,466
>> So concretely, you know, I can't remember all that stuff either.

49
00:02:30,483 --> 00:02:33,466
I'm a terrible typist, et cetera. So you'll see there's a ton

50
00:02:33,483 --> 00:02:37,466
of stuff in PowerShell that helps with those things. So really

51
00:02:37,483 --> 00:02:40,466
is a goal to not be able to memorize things. Actually, there's

52
00:02:41,483 --> 00:02:45,466
a great story. They recently did a study of Unix admins and came

53
00:02:45,483 --> 00:02:48,466
up with the support, and I was really amused by this, because

54
00:02:48,483 --> 00:02:53,400
basically about 25, 30 years ago they had done exactly the same

55
00:02:53,483 --> 00:02:56,466
study and produced exactly the same results. And here's what

56
00:02:56,483 --> 00:03:00,466
they did. They took a bunch of beginner Unix admins and expert

57
00:03:01,483 --> 00:03:04,466
Unix admins, and they said, hey, here's a test. If you wanted

58
00:03:04,483 --> 00:03:07,466
to do this, how do you do it? A written test. And what was interesting

59
00:03:07,483 --> 00:03:12,466
was that we scored these, there wasn't very much of a difference

60
00:03:12,483 --> 00:03:16,466
between the expert Unix admins and the beginning Unix admins.

61
00:03:16,483 --> 00:03:19,466
And so then it's like, oh, why are we paying these experts so

62
00:03:19,483 --> 00:03:20,466
much money, you know. They can't...

63
00:03:21,483 --> 00:03:26,466
objectively, they're not that much better than just some beginner, right?

64
00:03:26,483 --> 00:03:29,466
And so then they said, okay, well now let's put them in front

65
00:03:29,483 --> 00:03:33,466
of a machine and give them a set of tasks. And what you saw

66
00:03:33,483 --> 00:03:37,466
was this huge difference in performance, that the experts were

67
00:03:37,483 --> 00:03:41,466
able to perform amazing things that the beginners struggled with.

68
00:03:41,483 --> 00:03:45,466
And the conclusion was that what expert Unix guys are great at

69
00:03:45,483 --> 00:03:50,466
is not knowing things, but in figuring things out, okay?

70
00:03:50,483 --> 00:03:54,466
And so that's the deal. This is not about you sitting there saying,

71
00:03:54,483 --> 00:03:58,466
hey, it should work this way, right. No, no, no, that's not

72
00:03:58,483 --> 00:04:03,466
the deal. The deal is, hey, let me figure out how to do things.

73
00:04:03,233 --> 00:04:05,466
And so that's what 's all about. What you're going to learn

74
00:04:05,483 --> 00:04:08,466
is a schema, right you're going to learn a set of things.

75
00:04:08,483 --> 00:04:10,466
You're going to learn how to learn, and then you're going to

76
00:04:10,483 --> 00:04:14,316
use those techniques over and over again. And that's why, once

77
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:17,466
you learn how to use PowerShell, and you're managing, say, Exchange,

78
00:04:18,316 --> 00:04:21,183
then when someone says, oh, we got this link server, it's like

79
00:04:21,266 --> 00:04:23,466
well, let me have at it. And you'll be able to go and you'll

80
00:04:23,483 --> 00:04:27,366
be able to learn and learn and learn and just figure stuff out.

81
00:04:27,450 --> 00:04:30,466
>> So basically, what you're telling me is that the first time

82
00:04:30,183 --> 00:04:32,466
I walked up to a Unix guy and I said hey, how did you do that,

83
00:04:32,483 --> 00:04:38,466
and he turned around and usually barked at me going, RTFM, he

84
00:04:38,483 --> 00:04:43,466
was actually trying to educate me. He wasn't just being a terrible person?

85
00:04:43,483 --> 00:04:44,466
>> No. Both.

86
00:04:44,483 --> 00:04:48,183
>> Oh, okay. He was being both. And I think this is really the

87
00:04:48,266 --> 00:04:50,466
moral of the story is you're not going to be able to memorize

88
00:04:50,483 --> 00:04:55,466
stuff, guys. PowerShell V2 had, like, 236 core commandlets.

89
00:04:56,383 --> 00:04:59,466
Okay. I might be able to memorize those. When you start working

90
00:04:59,216 --> 00:05:02,466
with products, you know, Exchange has, depending on your version

91
00:05:02,483 --> 00:05:06,266
of Exchange, has between 535 and 610 commandlets. You've got

92
00:05:06,350 --> 00:05:09,466
500 and some odd commandlets for SharePoint. You've got 100

93
00:05:09,483 --> 00:05:13,466
and some odd commandlets for Active Directory. In Server 2012,

94
00:05:13,483 --> 00:05:16,466
you have thousands of commandlets now.

95
00:05:16,483 --> 00:05:17,466
>> Thousands, yep.

96
00:05:17,483 --> 00:05:21,0
>> There's no way to memorize them. So what they did is they

97
00:05:21,483 --> 00:05:25,466
created a Help system. Now, before you go oh, no, not another

98
00:05:25,483 --> 00:05:29,466
Help system, because I know, if you've... and I'm not...

99
00:05:29,483 --> 00:05:33,466
okay, maybe I am. If you've used the Help system in a particular

100
00:05:33,483 --> 00:05:38,333
product before and have found it unuseful, well, just remember

101
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:42,466
it wasn't spent a lot of time on. This was spent a lot of time

102
00:05:42,483 --> 00:05:45,466
on by people who wanted you to be successful, knew that the only

103
00:05:45,483 --> 00:05:49,466
way that you're going to be successful is to have a great Help system.

104
00:05:49,483 --> 00:05:53,466
We, all of us, use this every single day, and I want to point

105
00:05:54,483 --> 00:05:57,466
out, as Jeffrey was saying, it's about using the Help system,

106
00:05:57,483 --> 00:06:01,466
reading and comprehending it, and then figuring it out.

107
00:06:01,483 --> 00:06:04,433
We're IT pros. That's what we do. We figure things out.

108
00:06:04,483 --> 00:06:08,466
This is actually fun when you get... start working with it.

109
00:06:08,483 --> 00:06:11,466
But one of the challenges that we have is the RTFM side. I mean,

110
00:06:11,483 --> 00:06:14,466
as an IT pro, one of the reasons I got into IT is because I was

111
00:06:14,483 --> 00:06:17,466
really good at sitting down at a computer and just figuring it out.

112
00:06:17,483 --> 00:06:20,466
I didn't have to read the manual. Well, that's not going to

113
00:06:20,483 --> 00:06:23,466
work here. We're going to have to use and read and comprehend

114
00:06:23,483 --> 00:06:27,466
the manual, and they've made it really easy for us. So let's

115
00:06:27,483 --> 00:06:30,466
start doing a little Get Help stuff. First of all...

116
00:06:31,483 --> 00:06:34,466
and guys, some of this stuff is in the slides so we're just going

117
00:06:34,483 --> 00:06:38,466
to demonstrate it. First of all, let's talk about update help

118
00:06:38,483 --> 00:06:40,183
versus the way that we used to have it.

119
00:06:40,266 --> 00:06:43,466
>> Yeah, okay. So we used to ship the Help with the property,

120
00:06:43,483 --> 00:06:46,466
and it turned out that there are all sorts of problems with that.

121
00:06:46,483 --> 00:06:50,466
So basically, the way Microsoft works, because we ship to hundreds

122
00:06:50,483 --> 00:06:55,283
of millions of people, right, it really matters that the release

123
00:06:55,366 --> 00:06:58,466
is buttoned up, right, which is to say that you stop changing

124
00:06:58,483 --> 00:07:01,466
things and then you test and then you test and you test and you

125
00:07:01,483 --> 00:07:04,466
test, and then you release it. So what ended up happening was

126
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:08,466
that just as soon as you're putting the finishing bits on the

127
00:07:08,483 --> 00:07:12,466
code, the documentation has to be done. And, of course, that

128
00:07:12,483 --> 00:07:13,466
doesn't work.

129
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,466
But now it's cooked. Like hey, don't change it, because you might

130
00:07:16,483 --> 00:07:20,466
break something. So then it gets shipped and the documentation,

131
00:07:20,483 --> 00:07:24,183
there's differences between the documentation and the product,

132
00:07:24,266 --> 00:07:26,466
and the answer used to be, well, you know, hey, just hang in there.

133
00:07:27,333 --> 00:07:29,466
You'll release again in three years and we'll fix that.

134
00:07:29,483 --> 00:07:32,466
That's kind of a crummy answer. And then there was a second problem.

135
00:07:32,483 --> 00:07:36,333
The second problem is, guess what? The help is huge, right, because

136
00:07:36,483 --> 00:07:37,433
there's a ton of it.

137
00:07:37,483 --> 00:07:42,466
And then you say, well, jeez, I'm now going to a cloud world

138
00:07:42,483 --> 00:07:45,466
where I've go a gazillion machines, I got a gazillion servers.

139
00:07:45,483 --> 00:07:50,466
Want to use those, be as efficient as possible with those servers,

140
00:07:50,483 --> 00:07:52,466
and you don't need the help on all those servers. You need the

141
00:07:52,483 --> 00:07:54,466
help on the machine you're managing them from.

142
00:07:54,483 --> 00:07:55,166
>> Right.

143
00:07:55,483 --> 00:07:59,466
>> And to put the help on all those systems is just bogging down

144
00:07:59,483 --> 00:08:02,316
those servers with stuff that you're not going to use. So because

145
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:05,183
of those two problem, in Windows... sorry, PowerShell Version

146
00:08:05,266 --> 00:08:09,466
3, we moved to an updatable help model, which is to say we ship

147
00:08:09,483 --> 00:08:13,466
and there's some very kind of like structural help that we generate,

148
00:08:13,483 --> 00:08:17,466
based upon metadata. You'll see some examples of that. But then

149
00:08:17,483 --> 00:08:22,466
all the help text is available from download from the internet.

150
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:23,350
So that's the way that works.

151
00:08:23,433 --> 00:08:27,433
>> And let me just say that in V2, one of the challenges was if

152
00:08:27,483 --> 00:08:29,466
you were using the Help system and there's an example in there,

153
00:08:29,483 --> 00:08:31,466
there was a possibility, you know, that maybe that example was

154
00:08:31,483 --> 00:08:35,466
wrong, and I'll show you a way around that if you're in V2 to

155
00:08:35,483 --> 00:08:39,466
get the latest information for it. But really, the joy here

156
00:08:39,483 --> 00:08:43,466
with V3 here is as soon as Microsoft updates a help or they find

157
00:08:43,483 --> 00:08:47,466
an issue, my Help gets updated on my management station. So the

158
00:08:47,483 --> 00:08:49,466
first thing that we're going to do, and then we're going to take

159
00:08:49,483 --> 00:08:50,466
a break in a couple minutes...

160
00:08:50,183 --> 00:08:50,466
>> Wait, can I give an example?

161
00:08:50,483 --> 00:08:51,466
>> Oh, yeah.

162
00:08:51,483 --> 00:08:53,433
>> So I don't know if you ever use WQL.

163
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:53,466
>> Yeah.

164
00:08:53,483 --> 00:08:57,183
>> Okay, right. So I can never remember WQL. I just can't.

165
00:08:57,266 --> 00:08:59,250
It's one of those things, one of those... there's certain things

166
00:08:59,333 --> 00:09:04,466
that just never sink in for me. WQL is one of them. And so constantly,

167
00:09:04,183 --> 00:09:06,466
whenever I want to use that, I'd have to use search. And there's

168
00:09:06,483 --> 00:09:10,466
something about the search... the content, I can never find it

169
00:09:10,483 --> 00:09:13,350
on the internet either, right. So at some point, somebody had

170
00:09:13,433 --> 00:09:16,466
exactly the same problem. So they went on Microsoft Connect and

171
00:09:16,483 --> 00:09:19,466
said you ought to have an About topic for WQL.

172
00:09:20,483 --> 00:09:23,466
And guess what? They went and wrote one. And so now we have

173
00:09:23,483 --> 00:09:26,466
an About WQL, and it's just there. Point was you didn't have

174
00:09:26,483 --> 00:09:30,466
to wait for another release. You had a problem, you told us about

175
00:09:30,483 --> 00:09:34,466
your problem, and we responded. And then in a matter of, like, well...

176
00:09:34,483 --> 00:09:37,466
I forgot how long that one took. But there was one where somebody

177
00:09:37,483 --> 00:09:40,466
complained about an error in the documentation. Two days later,

178
00:09:40,483 --> 00:09:44,466
we had an update. So it's pretty peppy. It's continuous publishing.

179
00:09:44,483 --> 00:09:47,466
>> And so what you want to make sure that you're doing is you're

180
00:09:47,483 --> 00:09:49,466
updating Help. And let me show you how to do that. First of

181
00:09:49,483 --> 00:09:52,466
all, you're going to need an internet connection. There is a

182
00:09:52,483 --> 00:09:54,466
way around that. But let's just start with the basic update Help here.

183
00:09:54,483 --> 00:09:57,466
And so we've got a commandlet for that called update...

184
00:09:57,483 --> 00:10:00,466
update, get it... dash Help.

185
00:10:00,483 --> 00:10:01,466
>> What do you want to update?

186
00:10:01,483 --> 00:10:04,466
>> Yeah, what do you want to update? The Help. The verb, the noun.

187
00:10:04,483 --> 00:10:07,466
So that's working out. And I look to use dash force, and guys,

188
00:10:07,483 --> 00:10:10,466
this is something that you can run every single day to make sure

189
00:10:10,483 --> 00:10:12,466
you have the latest and greatest help. And what it's going to

190
00:10:12,483 --> 00:10:15,300
do, it's going to go out to the internet and it's going to download

191
00:10:15,483 --> 00:10:18,183
all of the Help files that you need for all of the stuff that

192
00:10:18,266 --> 00:10:19,316
you have on your system.

193
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:21,250
>> See that progress bar? Says ooooo.

194
00:10:22,483 --> 00:10:25,233
>> Which is what it should say in PowerShell. Oooo.

195
00:10:25,316 --> 00:10:26,466
>> So cool.

196
00:10:26,483 --> 00:10:28,466
>> Now look, if you have a series... a bunch of machines that

197
00:10:28,483 --> 00:10:32,216
don't have direct access to the internet, you can save this Help

198
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:34,466
with Save Help.

199
00:10:35,483 --> 00:10:40,466
You can save this Help as a set of files, and then you can update

200
00:10:40,483 --> 00:10:44,466
from that set of files. But having the internet connection sure

201
00:10:44,483 --> 00:10:46,466
does make your life a lot easier. Now here's the idea.

202
00:10:48,483 --> 00:10:51,250
We're going to take a break here and so what we want to do is

203
00:10:51,333 --> 00:10:53,466
make sure that you've got a PowerShell console up and make sure

204
00:10:54,333 --> 00:10:57,466
that you've updated Help, because when we come back, we're going

205
00:10:57,483 --> 00:11:00,466
to start using my favorite things. And let me just show them

206
00:11:00,483 --> 00:11:01,466
to you real quick.

207
00:11:02,483 --> 00:11:06,466
Get-Help, which, yep, that's going to get us help on stuff, but

208
00:11:06,483 --> 00:11:10,466
it's also going to help us search for stuff and so that's its

209
00:11:10,483 --> 00:11:13,466
most important thing. Before, though, we go, I want to show you

210
00:11:13,483 --> 00:11:16,450
there's a difference. You can see people use Get-Help.

211
00:11:17,0 --> 00:11:19,466
You're going to see people use Help, and you're going to see

212
00:11:19,483 --> 00:11:22,466
people use Man. And I want to show you that there's a difference

213
00:11:22,483 --> 00:11:25,466
between these two. Get-Help, and I'm just going to pick a commandlet

214
00:11:25,483 --> 00:11:27,466
and what I'm going to do is I'm going to keep things real simple

215
00:11:27,483 --> 00:11:30,300
right now. And I want you to notice my screen. It scrolled all

216
00:11:30,383 --> 00:11:33,316
the way to the bottom. Now, this is not a complete Help file,

217
00:11:33,483 --> 00:11:36,466
but we'll get to that after break. But I want you to notice

218
00:11:36,483 --> 00:11:39,333
it scrolled all the way down to the bottom. Now watch the difference

219
00:11:39,416 --> 00:11:42,466
between using Help on the same thing.

220
00:11:44,483 --> 00:11:46,466
Look at the bottom of my screen. See how I've got that little

221
00:11:46,483 --> 00:11:48,466
more so I can...

222
00:11:49,483 --> 00:11:53,466
you probably heard that. I can space bar now and move through

223
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:57,466
the Help file. Man does the same thing. So Man, and I'll do

224
00:11:57,483 --> 00:12:01,466
Get Service, gives you that same, you know, like you pipe to

225
00:12:01,483 --> 00:12:05,466
more kind of deal, where you can pound your way through it.

226
00:12:05,483 --> 00:12:09,466
Use whichever one makes you happiest, and probably today you

227
00:12:09,483 --> 00:12:13,466
should experiment. I know, I've got friends that are just Help.

228
00:12:13,483 --> 00:12:18,466
I always only use Help. I happen to be a Get-Help kind of guy,

229
00:12:18,483 --> 00:12:21,466
because I like it to scroll to the bottom of the screen.

230
00:12:21,483 --> 00:12:25,466
The Help system is a super discoverable, great tool to help me

231
00:12:25,483 --> 00:12:27,400
find things.

232
00:12:27,483 --> 00:12:30,466
And let's do a couple of examples. I'll start off, and then

233
00:12:30,483 --> 00:12:34,166
you can join in. This is going to be really awesome, because...

234
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:38,316
and don't memorize or write down anything that we do.

235
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:38,466
>> Yep.

236
00:12:38,483 --> 00:12:42,466
>> Swear to God. Don't do it, because that's kind of the whole point.

237
00:12:42,483 --> 00:12:45,466
So let me give you an example. First of all, Help has the ability

238
00:12:45,183 --> 00:12:48,416
to discover stuff. And I'm a Get Help... Get-Help kind of guy

239
00:12:48,483 --> 00:12:52,466
so I'm going to use Get-Help. And I want to find out... here's my...

240
00:12:52,483 --> 00:12:55,466
I want to see if there's any commandlets that can help me work

241
00:12:55,483 --> 00:13:00,466
with services. So I'm going to do star service star.

242
00:13:01,483 --> 00:13:04,466
>> By the way, star is your friend. Star is a wildcard, and it

243
00:13:04,483 --> 00:13:07,466
says find anything at the beginning or find anything at the end.

244
00:13:07,483 --> 00:13:09,466
Match anything at the beginning or end.

245
00:13:09,483 --> 00:13:14,466
>> Yeah, and make sure when you mean wildcard, you use a wildcard,

246
00:13:14,166 --> 00:13:17,466
because some commandlets will let you not use the wildcard and

247
00:13:17,483 --> 00:13:20,466
that's not a practice to get into. So... oh, my gosh, look

248
00:13:20,483 --> 00:13:24,166
at all of these commandlets. So many commandlets that have service

249
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:29,466
in them, whoa! But now is where the fun begins. Look. Is there

250
00:13:29,483 --> 00:13:33,466
a commandlets that, in this list, that looks like it might retrieve

251
00:13:33,483 --> 00:13:39,466
or, I don't know, get me a list of services on my computer? So yeah.

252
00:13:39,483 --> 00:13:42,416
There happens to be one right here. See Get-Service.

253
00:13:42,483 --> 00:13:45,466
It would probably get me a list of services.

254
00:13:46,216 --> 00:13:49,466
>> Show them the up arrow. Show them the up arrow.

255
00:13:49,483 --> 00:13:50,466
>> What am I...

256
00:13:50,483 --> 00:13:52,466
>> You can just use the up arrow. Now watch this. Now use the

257
00:13:52,483 --> 00:13:57,466
right arrow... left arrow and put a G in front of the star.

258
00:13:57,483 --> 00:13:58,466
Check this out.

259
00:13:59,483 --> 00:14:00,466
Now do it.

260
00:14:01,483 --> 00:14:02,466
>> Oh, got a short list.

261
00:14:02,483 --> 00:14:03,466
>> These wildcards are great.

262
00:14:03,483 --> 00:14:06,200
>> The wildcards are great, and actually knowing how to do a good

263
00:14:06,283 --> 00:14:09,466
search is really good. This is great, this is great. So here's

264
00:14:09,483 --> 00:14:12,466
the idea, and we're going to do this a couple times. The idea

265
00:14:12,483 --> 00:14:16,383
is you search for, probably by noun, you search for the thing

266
00:14:16,466 --> 00:14:19,466
that you want to find. I want to know something about processes

267
00:14:19,483 --> 00:14:22,466
or I want to know something about services, which are the examples

268
00:14:22,483 --> 00:14:26,333
I'm going to use a lot. But it could be as simple as AD computers

269
00:14:26,483 --> 00:14:29,316
or something like that. And you search for what you want and

270
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:32,466
when you find it, well, there's a Help file for it. So let's

271
00:14:32,483 --> 00:14:35,466
go in and take a look. I'm going to do Get-Help, Get-Service.

272
00:14:37,483 --> 00:14:40,383
Now, this is the simple view of the Help file and let me show

273
00:14:40,466 --> 00:14:44,466
it to you real quick. It gives you the name, synopsis, syntax

274
00:14:44,483 --> 00:14:47,466
which we're going to talk about here shortly, gives you a description

275
00:14:47,483 --> 00:14:50,466
of what the commandlet does and some related links and information.

276
00:14:51,433 --> 00:14:53,466
Now, this is not the full Help so don't panic. We're going to

277
00:14:53,483 --> 00:14:57,166
do the full Help. But let's try this discovery thing again.

278
00:14:57,483 --> 00:15:00,466
I want to do, let's see, Get-Help, and I want to find something that...

279
00:15:00,483 --> 00:15:03,466
oh, and I'm going to use your trick. I'm going to say that would

280
00:15:03,483 --> 00:15:04,466
G star

281
00:15:06,483 --> 00:15:09,416
something with AD computer in it.

282
00:15:10,166 --> 00:15:12,466
Because I want to work with Active Directory computers.

283
00:15:13,483 --> 00:15:17,466
Oh, look. There's a command there. Get AD computer. You know

284
00:15:17,483 --> 00:15:19,466
what I'm thinking? I'm thinking in my head that's probably going

285
00:15:19,483 --> 00:15:23,300
to solve my problem. But to be sure, what I'm going to do is

286
00:15:23,383 --> 00:15:28,466
do Get-Help, Get AD Computer and take a look at it.

287
00:15:31,483 --> 00:15:35,466
And again, this is the simple Help view and we'll get to a better

288
00:15:35,483 --> 00:15:39,466
ones here in just a second. But so the concept is pretty simple.

289
00:15:39,483 --> 00:15:42,466
What you want to do is you want to discover what you want to

290
00:15:42,483 --> 00:15:46,200
work with, and then look at the Help for what you want to work with.

291
00:15:46,283 --> 00:15:50,200
Now, the concept is simple, but doing this seems to be a lot of...

292
00:15:50,283 --> 00:15:53,466
a big challenge for a lot of folks. You have to become trusting

293
00:15:53,483 --> 00:15:57,466
in that this is how we do it, and this actually works. No matter

294
00:15:57,483 --> 00:16:00,466
what product you're working with, think of what is it that you

295
00:16:00,483 --> 00:16:05,466
want to do something to. What's the noun that you want to find?

296
00:16:05,483 --> 00:16:08,433
And then have Help search for it.

297
00:16:08,450 --> 00:16:08,466
>> Yep.

298
00:16:08,483 --> 00:16:10,466
>> Sounds like great way to get Help to work for it.

299
00:16:10,483 --> 00:16:13,466
>> Yeah, we very much tried to create a world where you could

300
00:16:13,483 --> 00:16:17,466
think about what you want, type it and get it, okay? So let's

301
00:16:17,483 --> 00:16:20,383
just say you wanted to assign something. Well, you'd look for

302
00:16:20,466 --> 00:16:23,466
assign and you wouldn't find that. You'd then quickly learn

303
00:16:23,483 --> 00:16:27,466
that we use the word set and so you'd say, well, okay. So there's

304
00:16:27,483 --> 00:16:30,466
an infinite number of nouns, but the verbs are pretty regular.

305
00:16:30,483 --> 00:16:34,333
So imagine you wanted to get the help on the verbs, like...

306
00:16:34,450 --> 00:16:34,466
>> Yeah.

307
00:16:35,250 --> 00:16:36,333
>> Like you type.

308
00:16:37,483 --> 00:16:38,466
>> Go ahead.

309
00:16:38,233 --> 00:16:43,466
>> So what you'd do is you'd say, you'd say Get Verb, and

310
00:16:44,483 --> 00:16:47,466
it shows you all the verbs. And so these are all the verbs that

311
00:16:47,483 --> 00:16:51,0
you're going to learn. And you see, well, how many are there?

312
00:16:51,483 --> 00:16:54,466
So you might want to say, well, get the verb. I'd like to measure them.

313
00:16:54,483 --> 00:16:58,466
And you see that there are 98 verbs. And here you see we break

314
00:16:58,483 --> 00:17:03,350
them up into, into, you know, whether they're security verbs

315
00:17:03,433 --> 00:17:05,466
or communication verbs, et cetera. Anyway, so those...

316
00:17:06,483 --> 00:17:09,316
you're going to learn those 98 things and then you're going to

317
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:11,466
be able to think, type, and get what you want.

318
00:17:11,483 --> 00:17:15,466
>> And what happens often is you're not even going to learn all

319
00:17:15,483 --> 00:17:17,466
98 of those. You're just going to learn a few of them, because

320
00:17:17,483 --> 00:17:19,466
you'll know that what the verbs will do for you, and you end

321
00:17:19,483 --> 00:17:23,466
up looking for the nouns. So it becomes a very easy process to

322
00:17:23,166 --> 00:17:25,466
follow through. But let's start getting into what this Help can

323
00:17:25,483 --> 00:17:29,466
do for us. So once again, I'm going to do this. Get-Help.

324
00:17:29,483 --> 00:17:33,466
I want to find command that will retrieve me some services.

325
00:17:33,483 --> 00:17:38,466
Now, notice, well, there is Get Service, and so I want to take

326
00:17:38,216 --> 00:17:42,466
a look at what this can do for me. So I'm going to do Get-Help

327
00:17:42,483 --> 00:17:45,466
and Get Service. Again, this is a simplified Help view. But there's

328
00:17:45,483 --> 00:17:49,466
more to Help than just this. Once you've updated Help, this Help

329
00:17:50,0 --> 00:17:52,466
can be extended or expanded upon. And let me show you a couple

330
00:17:53,333 --> 00:17:55,466
of things. This is where it gets oh, just so happy for me.

331
00:17:56,483 --> 00:18:00,466
Because watch. I'm going to do Get-Help on Get Service, but we

332
00:18:00,483 --> 00:18:04,466
have a parameter that will allow us to get detailed...

333
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:08,466
ooh, detailed help. And here's what detailed help is going to

334
00:18:08,483 --> 00:18:11,466
show us. I'm going to scroll all the way back to the top, and

335
00:18:11,483 --> 00:18:14,466
Get Service gives you the synopsis. Again the syntax, which

336
00:18:15,166 --> 00:18:16,466
we're going to talk about in a second, and the description.

337
00:18:16,483 --> 00:18:19,466
This is what we saw before, but here's this. When we talk about

338
00:18:19,483 --> 00:18:22,250
syntax, we're going to start talking about what these things

339
00:18:22,333 --> 00:18:27,466
are, parameters. These parameters change how the commandlet acts.

340
00:18:27,483 --> 00:18:30,466
Well, I don't necessarily know what these things mean.

341
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:33,466
Well, when you go to detailed help, look.

342
00:18:34,483 --> 00:18:38,466
The parameters are listed here with an explanation of what they mean.

343
00:18:38,483 --> 00:18:42,216
And so what you'll do is you'll actually be up here looking and

344
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:45,250
going I have no idea what that is. Then you can just scroll

345
00:18:45,333 --> 00:18:48,466
down and get a definition of the parameters. Also, as I scroll

346
00:18:48,483 --> 00:18:50,466
down here, I want you to notice something really interesting.

347
00:18:51,483 --> 00:18:54,466
Now we start to get examples. Now, I want you to think about

348
00:18:54,483 --> 00:18:57,466
this for a second. I've got a commandlet called Get-Service.

349
00:18:57,483 --> 00:18:59,466
So let's talk about what it's probably going to do. I haven't

350
00:18:59,483 --> 00:19:02,466
run it yet. It's probably going to give me, and if I read the

351
00:19:03,483 --> 00:19:07,266
description, a list of all of the services on my computer, whether

352
00:19:07,350 --> 00:19:10,466
they're running, stopped or paused. And it will tell me about that.

353
00:19:10,483 --> 00:19:13,433
How many examples of that do you really think we need?

354
00:19:14,366 --> 00:19:20,466
Well, we need 11 of them. And here's why I want to point this out.

355
00:19:20,483 --> 00:19:23,466
We apparently, we need 11 examples of this, and there's a reason

356
00:19:23,483 --> 00:19:26,466
for this. Because the people that work so hard on these Help

357
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:29,466
files knew that there were going to be all kinds of different

358
00:19:29,483 --> 00:19:32,466
ways that you're going to want to try to use this, and they wanted

359
00:19:32,483 --> 00:19:35,466
to give you examples. What happens is this is oftentimes you'll

360
00:19:35,483 --> 00:19:37,466
be thinking of a business problem or trying to solve a business

361
00:19:38,0 --> 00:19:40,466
problem, and you'll say, gee whiz, let me go. I found the commandlet.

362
00:19:40,483 --> 00:19:43,466
Let me go look at the example. You'll find an example that is

363
00:19:43,483 --> 00:19:48,466
really close to probably exactly what you wanted to do, which

364
00:19:48,483 --> 00:19:50,466
is one of the cool things. So a big shout-out to all the folks

365
00:19:50,483 --> 00:19:51,466
that work on...

366
00:19:51,483 --> 00:19:53,466
>> You know the other thing we did was there are few of the ones

367
00:19:53,483 --> 00:19:56,283
we knew people were going to use a lot, like Get Process.

368
00:19:56,366 --> 00:19:59,466
Boy, you always want to spend time looking at Get Process because

369
00:19:59,483 --> 00:20:03,466
there, what we did was we said, hey, Get Process, Get Service,

370
00:20:03,483 --> 00:20:05,466
people are going to use these a lot. And so in our Help in our

371
00:20:05,483 --> 00:20:08,466
examples, we show you not just how to use Get Process and Get

372
00:20:09,483 --> 00:20:13,466
Service, but we also show you some very common PowerShell techniques

373
00:20:13,483 --> 00:20:16,466
that then help you, you know, kind of lead you to the next step.

374
00:20:16,483 --> 00:20:18,466
You start off saying oh, I'd like to get something... Get Services,

375
00:20:18,483 --> 00:20:21,466
what do I want to do, and then you say, well, jeez, actually,

376
00:20:21,483 --> 00:20:24,466
I'd like to format it a little differently or I'd like to find

377
00:20:24,483 --> 00:20:28,466
these things, filter. And so we used those high volume topics

378
00:20:28,483 --> 00:20:31,416
to kind of go a little bit deeper, to teach you the next level

379
00:20:31,483 --> 00:20:32,333
of PowerShell.

380
00:20:32,483 --> 00:20:34,466
>> Which is you're going to... as we take you through learning

381
00:20:34,483 --> 00:20:36,466
all of this deep level part of PowerShell, you're going to look

382
00:20:36,483 --> 00:20:39,216
at these Help files in a totally new way, and you'll see that

383
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:43,466
examples of sorting and filtering and getting the kinds of information

384
00:20:43,483 --> 00:20:46,316
that you want and changing the kinds of information you want.

385
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:49,250
A lot of times, right in the examples. A lot of people, the

386
00:20:49,333 --> 00:20:52,0
first thing they do is they go to examples. As a matter of fact,

387
00:20:52,483 --> 00:20:55,466
there is, rather than detailed, you have a parameter called examples

388
00:20:56,450 --> 00:20:58,466
that will take you right into just the examples if you want to

389
00:20:58,483 --> 00:21:02,466
get there real quick. Something else that you can do, and this

390
00:21:03,483 --> 00:21:07,466
is going to become a big deal this afternoon as we work through

391
00:21:07,483 --> 00:21:09,466
this, there's also Full Help.

392
00:21:10,483 --> 00:21:12,466
I don't know, Jeffrey, I don't know if they can handle the Full Help.

393
00:21:12,483 --> 00:21:14,466
I mean, that's an awful lot...

394
00:21:14,483 --> 00:21:16,466
>> Stress test.

395
00:21:16,233 --> 00:21:17,466
>> There we go. Full Help.

396
00:21:17,483 --> 00:21:18,466
>> Put your seat belts on.

397
00:21:19,166 --> 00:21:20,466
>> Put your seat belts on.

398
00:21:21,333 --> 00:21:23,466
Full Help, guys, I'm going to tell you right now, the Full Help

399
00:21:23,483 --> 00:21:26,466
is very similar to Detailed, except when you're in the parameters,

400
00:21:27,483 --> 00:21:29,466
there's some special information, and this is going to make,

401
00:21:29,483 --> 00:21:32,466
in the next section when we're going to talk about what this

402
00:21:32,483 --> 00:21:35,466
information means to you, it's actually very important to us.

403
00:21:35,483 --> 00:21:38,466
And this will help us understand how the commands work in the

404
00:21:38,483 --> 00:21:41,400
pipeline and so we're going to talk about that stuff in a little bit.

405
00:21:41,483 --> 00:21:45,366
So right now, when you're running Get Help, you can use detailed

406
00:21:45,450 --> 00:21:48,466
or you can use examples, but a little bit later on, you'll always

407
00:21:48,483 --> 00:21:51,466
end up using full. Now, I want to... I promised you earlier

408
00:21:51,483 --> 00:21:55,466
that for you folks that are running PowerShell V2, and even if

409
00:21:55,483 --> 00:21:59,466
you're running V3, sometimes if you're running V2, your Help

410
00:21:59,483 --> 00:22:03,466
files, they're not up to date and you want the latest. I need

411
00:22:03,483 --> 00:22:07,333
the latest and greatest information. Well, you can't run Update

412
00:22:07,483 --> 00:22:10,250
Help if you're in V2, which is why on your admin box you should

413
00:22:10,333 --> 00:22:10,466
be running V3.

414
00:22:11,483 --> 00:22:15,466
However, let me just show you. This is how we used to get around that.

415
00:22:15,483 --> 00:22:17,383
Microsoft helped us with this.

416
00:22:18,483 --> 00:22:21,466
Dash online. I love this. Dash online.

417
00:22:22,466 --> 00:22:25,466
Looky what it just did. Takes me... opens up a browser, takes

418
00:22:25,483 --> 00:22:28,466
me out. Look, updated, shows you when it was last updated and

419
00:22:28,483 --> 00:22:30,300
here's the Full Help

420
00:22:31,483 --> 00:22:35,166
for whatever it is I was looking for. In this case, Get Service.

421
00:22:35,483 --> 00:22:40,466
So again, don't close that. I'll lose the chat. Dash online.

422
00:22:40,483 --> 00:22:42,400
>> Can I show my favorite?

423
00:22:42,483 --> 00:22:46,433
>> Yeah, because... I hope you do. I was confused by this at

424
00:22:46,483 --> 00:22:48,433
first, but go ahead.

425
00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:48,466
>> But what?

426
00:22:48,483 --> 00:22:50,466
>> I'll show you. You go.

427
00:22:50,483 --> 00:22:59,166
>> Okay. So let's swap to mine. So here we do Get Help, Get Service.

428
00:22:59,483 --> 00:23:03,466
So here's the thing. You can say examples, right? Examples.

429
00:23:04,350 --> 00:23:06,466
And you say oh, that's cool. Let's, let's, let's run this.

430
00:23:07,166 --> 00:23:11,383
Let's, let's, let's, let's, let's do one of these, okay?

431
00:23:11,466 --> 00:23:15,466
And type that and by the way, so you do, you do enter and then

432
00:23:15,483 --> 00:23:20,283
left mouse button, and okay great. Now you want to do the next one.

433
00:23:20,366 --> 00:23:25,466
Oh, well, so you see... the work flow's all messed up. So what

434
00:23:25,483 --> 00:23:27,466
you can do is you can say

435
00:23:29,483 --> 00:23:34,466
Get Help minus show. Show window. And look here. Comes up in

436
00:23:34,483 --> 00:23:39,466
a window. Okay? Now this has all sorts of great stuff. One of

437
00:23:39,483 --> 00:23:44,466
these is settings, and you can say, hey, I want to just see...

438
00:23:44,483 --> 00:23:45,466
I don't want to see all this stuff.

439
00:23:46,383 --> 00:23:48,466
I just want to see the examples.

440
00:23:50,166 --> 00:23:51,466
Look at all the stuff you can have control over.

441
00:23:51,483 --> 00:23:53,333
>> I know, it's amazing to me.

442
00:23:53,483 --> 00:23:58,466
>> So now you just go here, cut, paste... sorry.

443
00:23:58,483 --> 00:24:02,466
Paste and do that. And then the next one.

444
00:24:05,483 --> 00:24:10,433
Cut, paste. And so it's a very nice work flow, much nicer work flow.

445
00:24:10,450 --> 00:24:10,466
>> Yeah.

446
00:24:10,483 --> 00:24:17,350
>> So again, that is this, this Show Window. And there's some

447
00:24:17,433 --> 00:24:19,433
really fun stuff with Show Window. Can I spend some more time

448
00:24:19,450 --> 00:24:19,466
on Show Window?

449
00:24:19,483 --> 00:24:20,433
>> Yeah, absolutely.

450
00:24:20,483 --> 00:24:22,466
>> Okay. So now let's turn all this back on there.

451
00:24:23,483 --> 00:24:27,466
So you say it's got lots of stuff here.

452
00:24:29,483 --> 00:24:32,466
So now, in the Show Window, you can do things like remember...

453
00:24:32,483 --> 00:24:35,350
what is it? Well, anyway, you got a find here.

454
00:24:35,483 --> 00:24:41,466
So you can find stuff, like dependent. Depend. Okay. And so

455
00:24:41,483 --> 00:24:44,466
notice it gets highlighted and says here, it says

456
00:24:46,483 --> 00:24:52,466
18 matches, okay? And you can search. Didn't do that very well.

457
00:24:53,166 --> 00:24:55,466
So anyway, then you can start searching for these things.

458
00:24:55,483 --> 00:24:57,466
And so it's super nice.

459
00:24:57,483 --> 00:25:00,466
>> And I think the addition of this, this was added to V3, and

460
00:25:00,483 --> 00:25:03,466
I think the addition of this is really phenomenal, because guys,

461
00:25:03,483 --> 00:25:07,466
let me show you. Traditionally, you're going to spend so much

462
00:25:07,483 --> 00:25:10,466
time in the Help file, and you're going to want to do just that.

463
00:25:10,483 --> 00:25:13,466
You're going to want to cut and paste from a Help file or you're

464
00:25:13,483 --> 00:25:16,466
going to want to read a Help file while you're working in PowerShell

465
00:25:16,483 --> 00:25:18,466
that a lot of times what a lot of guys would do, if you take

466
00:25:19,333 --> 00:25:23,466
at my screen, I'm just going to launch two PowerShell sessions.

467
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:26,183
Now, if you have two monitors, this is great, right? So you do

468
00:25:26,266 --> 00:25:30,466
Help in one and then you can work in another one. But with V3,

469
00:25:31,483 --> 00:25:37,466
having the Show Window stuff, well, first of all, it fits better

470
00:25:37,483 --> 00:25:40,466
on your screen. It's easy to move around. You can have the Help.

471
00:25:40,483 --> 00:25:43,466
It's easier to get stuff... the part that always confuses me

472
00:25:43,483 --> 00:25:46,466
is, and we're going to fix this later when we start talking about

473
00:25:46,483 --> 00:25:51,466
the magical ISE, but it's the cut and the paste, man. It's that whole...

474
00:25:52,166 --> 00:25:52,466
>> Yeah, yeah, yeah.

475
00:25:52,483 --> 00:25:55,466
>> It's that right clicking and stuff in the console. Why can't

476
00:25:55,483 --> 00:26:00,433
we fix that? Why can't we fix that? Why can't we fix that, that console?

477
00:26:01,483 --> 00:26:02,316
>> Because it's horrible.

478
00:26:02,483 --> 00:26:04,466
>> Okay. That's the answer I wanted.

479
00:26:04,483 --> 00:26:07,466
>> So here's the thing. Here's the thing. So let me give you

480
00:26:07,483 --> 00:26:12,466
a little tutorial about some of the behind the scenes stuff at Microsoft.

481
00:26:12,233 --> 00:26:15,466
So there was some point where people said, oh, you know, Microsoft

482
00:26:15,483 --> 00:26:20,466
stopped advancing IE, you know. Oh, that just proves what bad

483
00:26:20,483 --> 00:26:23,466
guys they are. There's no competition. They stopped innovating.

484
00:26:23,483 --> 00:26:26,233
No, no, no my friends. Honestly, that's not what happened.

485
00:26:26,316 --> 00:26:27,350
What happened

486
00:26:28,483 --> 00:26:32,466
was that it got to the point where every time we made a change,

487
00:26:32,183 --> 00:26:34,166
we broke a bunch of people, right?

488
00:26:34,250 --> 00:26:34,466
>> Right.

489
00:26:34,483 --> 00:26:38,466
>> So then it's like people are like hey, jerk, stop breaking us.

490
00:26:38,483 --> 00:26:42,466
And so... and so they stopped doing that. And then all of a

491
00:26:42,483 --> 00:26:45,466
sudden, some competitors got up there, and so now they went and

492
00:26:45,483 --> 00:26:49,466
started doing things even though sometimes things break.

493
00:26:49,483 --> 00:26:52,466
Same thing happens with the console window. The console window,

494
00:26:52,183 --> 00:26:56,466
man, every time you change that thing, you break tons of people.

495
00:26:56,483 --> 00:26:59,466
You just break tons of them. And so you don't want to change

496
00:26:59,483 --> 00:27:02,466
that thing very much. Now, here's the thing. Actually, I'm pretty

497
00:27:02,483 --> 00:27:06,466
hostile to the console window, okay? So that's it. I'm trying

498
00:27:06,483 --> 00:27:09,466
to make this thing die. I'll just be straight up about it.

499
00:27:09,483 --> 00:27:13,466
Make it die. And why is that? And the answer is that there are

500
00:27:13,483 --> 00:27:17,466
these things called console apps, okay. Now, a console app only

501
00:27:17,483 --> 00:27:21,466
works in the console. Now, here's why I want to kill the console,

502
00:27:22,333 --> 00:27:25,166
because I want to kill console apps. And it turns out that the

503
00:27:25,250 --> 00:27:27,466
reason I want to kill console apps is you go and you write...

504
00:27:27,483 --> 00:27:30,466
you do something on the console app and it writes directly on

505
00:27:31,0 --> 00:27:34,466
to the console, which means you cannot automate it, okay?

506
00:27:34,483 --> 00:27:39,466
You can't run something, get its output, process the output,

507
00:27:39,483 --> 00:27:42,466
and do something with it because it writes directly on the screen.

508
00:27:42,483 --> 00:27:46,466
So this is just evil incarnate. It is the enemy of automation

509
00:27:46,166 --> 00:27:48,466
so we're trying to get rid of those things. So we're trying

510
00:27:48,483 --> 00:27:54,433
to get everybody on to PowerShell ISE, which is a much richer investment.

511
00:27:54,483 --> 00:27:57,466
So by the way, stop asking me to fix the console. I'm not going

512
00:27:57,483 --> 00:27:58,466
to fix the console.

513
00:27:58,483 --> 00:28:02,0
>> And that's the point is that the console... and look, I know

514
00:28:02,483 --> 00:28:04,466
cut and pasting in the console and some guys go the console's

515
00:28:04,483 --> 00:28:06,466
driving me nuts. A little bit later on today, we're going to

516
00:28:06,483 --> 00:28:10,316
help you with, well, he hates it and so there's actually a really

517
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:12,466
cool solution to it. But I want you to wait until we get there

518
00:28:12,483 --> 00:28:17,466
with the ISE. So to cut and paste in the console is, if you haven't

519
00:28:17,483 --> 00:28:22,466
done it, yep, you highlight it, you right click, and then you

520
00:28:22,483 --> 00:28:27,183
can right click again. So no control C, no control V in this puppy.

521
00:28:27,266 --> 00:28:31,466
I think we may have something cooler for you later on. But right

522
00:28:31,483 --> 00:28:34,466
now, that's how you do it. So right click and right click will

523
00:28:34,483 --> 00:28:37,466
take care of it for you. Jeffrey, you know what we need to do?

524
00:28:37,483 --> 00:28:39,466
We need to start to take a look at

525
00:28:40,483 --> 00:28:42,433
and explaining syntax.

526
00:28:42,450 --> 00:28:42,466
>> Yeah.

527
00:28:43,333 --> 00:28:47,466
>> Because here's the thing. Everybody wants to work with commandlet,

528
00:28:47,483 --> 00:28:50,250
but, you know, commandlet is going to do great stuff for you,

529
00:28:50,333 --> 00:28:54,383
but sometimes you want the commandlet to alter its output or

530
00:28:54,466 --> 00:28:57,216
change what it's actually doing for you. You know, Get Service

531
00:28:57,300 --> 00:28:59,466
is great, but it's going to give you a list of all your services.

532
00:29:00,483 --> 00:29:04,466
Maybe I just want the one called bits or something like that.

533
00:29:04,216 --> 00:29:07,466
So the syntax of the commandlet will explain to you the options

534
00:29:07,483 --> 00:29:10,466
that you have available to control the commandlet. And so at

535
00:29:11,483 --> 00:29:14,466
first, it looks very, very confusing. Now, we've got slides

536
00:29:14,483 --> 00:29:17,466
for this, and so it's all in the slide deck. But let's take

537
00:29:17,483 --> 00:29:20,283
a look here. I've got Get Service up right now, and I'm going

538
00:29:20,366 --> 00:29:21,466
to take a look at something pretty simple.

539
00:29:21,483 --> 00:29:24,466
>> You know what? If you do this in Show Window, it comes out better.

540
00:29:24,483 --> 00:29:25,466
>> You like it in Show Window better?

541
00:29:25,483 --> 00:29:26,433
>> Yeah, because watch. Do it.

542
00:29:26,450 --> 00:29:26,466
>> Oh.

543
00:29:26,483 --> 00:29:28,466
>> No, you do it.

544
00:29:30,483 --> 00:29:32,466
>> Let's do Show Window.

545
00:29:32,483 --> 00:29:36,466
>> See, because one, you've got the zoom there down at the bottom.

546
00:29:36,483 --> 00:29:38,316
You didn't notice that?

547
00:29:38,483 --> 00:29:41,183
>> Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

548
00:29:41,483 --> 00:29:42,466
Oh, that's very, very nice.

549
00:29:42,483 --> 00:29:45,466
>> The other thing is it highlights some things. So I think it's

550
00:29:45,483 --> 00:29:46,466
a little bit easier to read.

551
00:29:46,483 --> 00:29:47,466
>> Very easy to read.

552
00:29:47,483 --> 00:29:49,466
>> And it's easier to select and say...

553
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:53,466
>> Okay. So we're going to use... we're going to use this instead.

554
00:29:53,483 --> 00:29:56,466
This is much better. So take a look at this right here. See the

555
00:29:56,483 --> 00:29:59,216
thing with the dash in front of it? So you'll notice that I've

556
00:29:59,300 --> 00:30:02,466
got a commandlet, and then it starts followed by all of this

557
00:30:02,483 --> 00:30:04,466
magical characters, and we're going to explain what all these

558
00:30:04,483 --> 00:30:06,466
characters are, but the first thing I want you to notice is look

559
00:30:06,483 --> 00:30:10,466
how many times under syntax I see the name of this commandlet.

560
00:30:10,483 --> 00:30:13,466
I see it three times. Now, Jeffrey, technically, this is called

561
00:30:13,483 --> 00:30:17,466
parameter sets, but why am I seeing three of these?

562
00:30:17,483 --> 00:30:20,416
>> Yeah, so here's the thing. Imagine... take a look at the net

563
00:30:20,483 --> 00:30:24,466
command, right? There's net use and net view, et cetera.

564
00:30:25,483 --> 00:30:28,466
These are different parameter sets. And what happens is when

565
00:30:28,483 --> 00:30:31,466
you type net view, you get one set of functionality. When you

566
00:30:31,483 --> 00:30:35,466
type net use, you get a different set of functionality. So what

567
00:30:35,483 --> 00:30:40,466
happens is that they then reuse the word, command net. Now, that's

568
00:30:40,483 --> 00:30:43,466
essentially what a parameter set is. Now, we take a different

569
00:30:43,483 --> 00:30:48,466
take on it. Net use is extremely different functionality than

570
00:30:48,483 --> 00:30:52,466
net views, okay. So we don't like that. We want to be clear.

571
00:30:52,483 --> 00:30:56,466
But the point about Get Service is that there are different parameter sets.

572
00:30:56,483 --> 00:30:59,466
Sometimes you want to say Get Service based upon its name.

573
00:30:59,483 --> 00:31:03,350
Or you're going to say I want to get service based upon its display

574
00:31:03,433 --> 00:31:06,450
name, okay. So those are two different parameter sets. A better

575
00:31:06,483 --> 00:31:10,466
example would be Get Process. Sometimes you want to say Get Process

576
00:31:10,483 --> 00:31:14,466
whose name is this. Sometimes you want to say Get Process whose

577
00:31:14,483 --> 00:31:18,466
ID is this. Or sometimes you go and just say Get Process and

578
00:31:18,483 --> 00:31:19,433
get them all.

579
00:31:19,450 --> 00:31:19,466
>> And get them all.

580
00:31:19,483 --> 00:31:22,466
>> Yeah, so those are different parameter sets.

581
00:31:22,483 --> 00:31:24,466
>> And let me show you what Jeremy is talking about. Notice in

582
00:31:24,483 --> 00:31:27,200
these three different Get Services, and yeah, don't worry, we'll

583
00:31:27,283 --> 00:31:29,466
take a look at Get Process too. In these three different Get

584
00:31:29,483 --> 00:31:32,466
Services, look at this one. This one has dash name. Down here

585
00:31:32,483 --> 00:31:36,466
in these other two, you don't see dash name. This one has dash

586
00:31:36,483 --> 00:31:39,466
display name. You don't see that in the other two. So that's

587
00:31:39,483 --> 00:31:43,466
what makes that particular parameter set unique. As a matter

588
00:31:43,483 --> 00:31:45,466
of fact, I'm going to demonstrate these here in just a second.

589
00:31:46,483 --> 00:31:48,466
But again, look at these dashes.

590
00:31:49,483 --> 00:31:54,466
These dashes indicate that they're parameters. Dashes.

591
00:31:54,483 --> 00:31:57,466
Parameters. Parameters will allow you to change the results of

592
00:31:57,483 --> 00:32:00,466
what the command's going to do, and I want to do an example for you.

593
00:32:00,233 --> 00:32:03,466
Let's take a look at dash name. I want you to notice it's followed

594
00:32:03,483 --> 00:32:06,466
by these characters here. I just kind of go like this, call them

595
00:32:06,483 --> 00:32:08,300
chihuahuas or something like this.

596
00:32:08,483 --> 00:32:12,466
>> Chihuahuas? That's the technical term. Not many people knew that.

597
00:32:12,483 --> 00:32:14,383
I didn't realize that you...

598
00:32:14,466 --> 00:32:19,466
>> The official technical term now is chihuahuas. And what this

599
00:32:19,483 --> 00:32:22,466
is is this is the kind of values that you can give this...

600
00:32:22,483 --> 00:32:25,283
>> I think we're going to get in trouble with HR on that one.

601
00:32:25,366 --> 00:32:27,466
>> Really? Okay. These things...

602
00:32:28,483 --> 00:32:29,183
>> Chihuahuas.

603
00:32:29,266 --> 00:32:30,466
>> No, like Pacman, Pacman.

604
00:32:30,483 --> 00:32:31,466
>> Uh-huh, Pacman.

605
00:32:31,183 --> 00:32:33,466
>> So these can be...

606
00:32:33,483 --> 00:32:37,466
now these are the values that you can give to the parameter.

607
00:32:37,483 --> 00:32:40,466
I'm going to show you. So let me give you a quick example here.

608
00:32:40,483 --> 00:32:42,466
Let me lower this down. Well, I'm not going to lower it down.

609
00:32:43,166 --> 00:32:45,466
I'll just do it here. Watch. I'm going to do Get Service and

610
00:32:45,483 --> 00:32:47,466
I'm going to use one of the parameters. Now, parameters always

611
00:32:47,483 --> 00:32:51,333
begin with a dash. So make sure you always put a dash in front

612
00:32:51,416 --> 00:32:54,466
of the parameters. And now I'm going to put in a value that would

613
00:32:54,483 --> 00:32:57,250
be inside those chihuahuas, and it said that the value type was

614
00:32:57,333 --> 00:33:00,283
string, which means alpha numeric, and I'm going to put in the

615
00:33:00,366 --> 00:33:04,466
name, which is a short name, of a service. I'm going to do bits.

616
00:33:04,483 --> 00:33:08,466
Instead of getting the entire service list, this parameter now

617
00:33:08,483 --> 00:33:11,466
is going to allow me to just get the service that I want.

618
00:33:11,483 --> 00:33:16,466
So here's the idea. Parameters can have these arguments on them.

619
00:33:16,483 --> 00:33:19,466
And a lot of parameters can take multiple arguments. And let

620
00:33:19,483 --> 00:33:23,466
me show you what they look like. Let's say I wanted two services.

621
00:33:24,483 --> 00:33:27,466
Notice the comma in between. Now, the space is optional, but

622
00:33:27,483 --> 00:33:29,466
put a space in here, makes it easier to read.

623
00:33:30,333 --> 00:33:34,466
Now I get those two. Let me show you how that looks in the syntax,

624
00:33:34,483 --> 00:33:38,450
and so let's go back here. Notice up here, at dash name, that's

625
00:33:38,483 --> 00:33:39,250
the parameter.

626
00:33:39,483 --> 00:33:43,466
Then we have the chihuahuas with the type of data that we can

627
00:33:43,483 --> 00:33:47,466
put in there the value type. See these guys inside? These guys.

628
00:33:47,483 --> 00:33:50,466
And you got to do them close together, because we've got these

629
00:33:50,483 --> 00:33:52,466
guys and we've got these guys.

630
00:33:52,483 --> 00:33:53,466
>> Those are chihuahuas. What are these?

631
00:33:53,483 --> 00:33:56,200
>> Chihuahuas, I just call them binkies because they're inside.

632
00:33:56,283 --> 00:33:56,333
>> Binkies.

633
00:33:56,416 --> 00:34:01,466
>> Yeah. I got chihuahuas and inside the chihuahuas you have these binkies.

634
00:34:01,483 --> 00:34:04,466
If you see binkies in there, that means you can take multiple

635
00:34:04,483 --> 00:34:08,466
values, separated by a comma. Now, I'll show you some stuff later

636
00:34:08,483 --> 00:34:12,466
where you won't see the internal binky, and so... boy, there's

637
00:34:12,483 --> 00:34:16,466
going to be a whole phrase book now. And so can only take one

638
00:34:16,483 --> 00:34:19,216
value, and this is very important for you to be able to know.

639
00:34:19,300 --> 00:34:21,466
But here's the part where it starts to get a little confusing.

640
00:34:22,266 --> 00:34:23,416
Let me do a

641
00:34:24,483 --> 00:34:28,466
little demonstration here of dash name with multiple values,

642
00:34:28,483 --> 00:34:31,466
which I just did, but let me show you something else.

643
00:34:31,483 --> 00:34:34,283
This isn't the confusing part. I'm going to ask Jeffrey about

644
00:34:34,366 --> 00:34:38,300
this confusing part. Again, you can do wildcards. So dash main

645
00:34:38,383 --> 00:34:42,166
B star means I'm going to get all the services listed that begin

646
00:34:42,450 --> 00:34:42,466
with B.

647
00:34:42,483 --> 00:34:47,466
>> There's no conflict between wildcards and arrays or collections.

648
00:34:47,483 --> 00:34:50,466
So do this. Do the up arrow. Now do...

649
00:34:51,333 --> 00:34:54,466
now comma C star.

650
00:34:54,216 --> 00:34:56,433
>> Oh, yeah, yeah. This is... oh, yeah. Great point.

651
00:34:56,450 --> 00:34:56,466
>> Yeah.

652
00:34:56,483 --> 00:34:59,466
>> Great point. So now I get both the ones that begin with Bs

653
00:34:59,483 --> 00:35:02,466
and with Cs. And see, that's awesome. That's totally awesome.

654
00:35:02,483 --> 00:35:05,466
So oh, I closed my Show Window. So let me go up here

655
00:35:07,483 --> 00:35:09,466
and open up the Show Window.

656
00:35:09,483 --> 00:35:12,250
Here's the part where I start getting kind of confused here,

657
00:35:12,333 --> 00:35:15,466
and this originally kind of threw me off is I want you guys to

658
00:35:15,166 --> 00:35:16,466
notice this guy down here.

659
00:35:17,266 --> 00:35:20,466
Computer name. And I want you to notice what's around computer name.

660
00:35:20,483 --> 00:35:25,466
See these brackets that surround both the parameter and the argument there?

661
00:35:25,483 --> 00:35:28,166
So it's not the internal binkies inside the chihuahuas.

662
00:35:28,250 --> 00:35:32,366
It's these things that surround either the parameter or the parameter

663
00:35:32,450 --> 00:35:33,466
and its argument.

664
00:35:34,483 --> 00:35:38,200
This means you don't have to use it. It's optional. But wait,

665
00:35:38,283 --> 00:35:44,316
we're not done yet. Great example is take a look at this first syntax.

666
00:35:44,483 --> 00:35:46,466
This syntax up here.

667
00:35:47,483 --> 00:35:53,466
Notice that everything has these around it. Which means that

668
00:35:53,483 --> 00:35:57,466
there's nothing actually required that I type in. Notice I've

669
00:35:57,483 --> 00:35:59,466
got them around here. Got them around here.

670
00:36:00,483 --> 00:36:05,466
And every single one of them, optional. That means all's I need

671
00:36:05,483 --> 00:36:11,466
to do or all's I have to do is type Get Service, and it gives

672
00:36:11,483 --> 00:36:14,466
me a whole list. In other words, no parameters were required.

673
00:36:15,433 --> 00:36:19,366
But take a look at this.

674
00:36:20,483 --> 00:36:23,466
Inside the syntax. Look at this second syntax.

675
00:36:23,483 --> 00:36:26,466
I want you to notice, look at this guy down here.

676
00:36:27,483 --> 00:36:31,466
See how display name doesn't have these around it?

677
00:36:32,483 --> 00:36:35,466
Well, that means if you're going to use display name, you've

678
00:36:35,483 --> 00:36:38,466
got to put it in, and then you've got to give me a value for it.

679
00:36:39,483 --> 00:36:40,466
Now, here's an example.

680
00:36:41,483 --> 00:36:46,466
Display name, by the way, is the long name.

681
00:36:46,483 --> 00:36:51,466
So it's this really long name. And I can Get Services by that

682
00:36:51,483 --> 00:36:55,333
display name, but I want you to notice that you've got a choice.

683
00:36:55,416 --> 00:37:02,466
Dash name or dash display name. So Get Service-display name.

684
00:37:03,483 --> 00:37:07,466
And now I can type in whatever long lengthy, and I'm just making

685
00:37:07,483 --> 00:37:10,466
it up, display name that I want to type in. But if you're going

686
00:37:10,483 --> 00:37:13,466
to use display name, now you have to use display name and the

687
00:37:14,166 --> 00:37:17,466
value that goes with it. That's what gets you into that other syntax.

688
00:37:18,483 --> 00:37:21,466
Let's do something else. Let's do stop.

689
00:37:21,233 --> 00:37:23,433
>> Wait, your didn't show them... so here's the thing.

690
00:37:23,450 --> 00:37:23,466
>> Yeah.

691
00:37:23,483 --> 00:37:28,466
>> So imagine you wanted to get like... do a Get Service B star.

692
00:37:30,450 --> 00:37:30,466
>> Just V star?

693
00:37:30,483 --> 00:37:31,466
>> B, B.

694
00:37:31,483 --> 00:37:32,333
>> Oh, B star.

695
00:37:32,483 --> 00:37:38,466
>> Okay. So look at this. The name for bit locker drive encryption

696
00:37:38,216 --> 00:37:43,466
service is BDESV. Now remember we said, oh, you want to create

697
00:37:43,483 --> 00:37:45,466
a world where you think about what you want, you type it and

698
00:37:45,483 --> 00:37:49,166
you get it. How many of you were thinking oh, I want to get the

699
00:37:50,483 --> 00:37:52,466
BDESVC service, right?

700
00:37:53,483 --> 00:37:57,466
So no, you want bit locker, okay? So then you want to say, okay,

701
00:37:57,483 --> 00:38:01,466
well Get Service display bit... no, you can't type bit locker.

702
00:38:01,483 --> 00:38:04,466
It's bit locker drive encryption service.

703
00:38:04,483 --> 00:38:11,466
So remember, partial's great because I'm flawed pipe can't remember

704
00:38:11,483 --> 00:38:13,466
BDESVC, and I'm definitely

705
00:38:14,483 --> 00:38:18,466
not going to remember bit locker drive encryption service.

706
00:38:18,483 --> 00:38:22,466
And look, even if I could remember it, I can guarantee you I cannot...

707
00:38:22,483 --> 00:38:27,466
I'm like incapable of typing that correctly. So what you do

708
00:38:27,483 --> 00:38:28,283
is you type...

709
00:38:28,483 --> 00:38:29,466
>> Display name.

710
00:38:30,483 --> 00:38:32,466
>> Bit star. No, just bit...

711
00:38:32,483 --> 00:38:34,166
>> Oh, just bit star, yeah.

712
00:38:34,483 --> 00:38:38,466
>> Bit star. Something to do with bit locker. Boom, and it just works.

713
00:38:38,483 --> 00:38:41,466
>> It got us by the long name which actually makes more human

714
00:38:41,483 --> 00:38:44,466
sense than those little tiny short names.

715
00:38:44,183 --> 00:38:47,466
>> One of the things we said was with PowerShell, it's like programming

716
00:38:47,483 --> 00:38:51,466
with hand grenades, versus sniper rifles, you know. It just

717
00:38:51,483 --> 00:38:54,466
sort of, just sort of like over there. I don't know if I ever

718
00:38:54,483 --> 00:38:55,466
told you that story.

719
00:38:55,483 --> 00:39:01,466
My buddy, college, I... my roommate used to be in Vietnam.

720
00:39:01,483 --> 00:39:04,466
He was a Vietnam... 18, Special Forces. No, that was actually

721
00:39:04,483 --> 00:39:06,466
the other guy that I worked with. He was a Navy SEAL. And the

722
00:39:07,483 --> 00:39:10,216
Navy SEALs get their own weapons, right. So everybody else,

723
00:39:10,300 --> 00:39:11,466
like you're this kind of guy, you get this kind of weapon.

724
00:39:11,483 --> 00:39:15,466
The Navy SEALs, like the gun manufacturers would make them guns.

725
00:39:15,483 --> 00:39:18,466
And he talked about this thing. I never quite got it in focus,

726
00:39:18,483 --> 00:39:23,466
but it's basically sort of like a machine gun/shotgun, a machine shotgun.

727
00:39:23,483 --> 00:39:26,466
He said, and the great thing about that was in Vietnam, you know,

728
00:39:26,483 --> 00:39:30,283
you had the jungle, and you sort of only had to know, like, is

729
00:39:30,366 --> 00:39:34,166
my problem over there or over there? And you'd set up with this

730
00:39:34,483 --> 00:39:37,466
thing and he says you'd let loose with it and three seconds later,

731
00:39:37,483 --> 00:39:39,466
your problem was gone or everything between you and your problem

732
00:39:39,483 --> 00:39:40,433
was gone.

733
00:39:40,450 --> 00:39:40,466
>> Was gone.

734
00:39:41,166 --> 00:39:43,350
>> Focusing on your problem. Well, that's the same sort of thing.

735
00:39:43,433 --> 00:39:47,466
You're just sort of like, hey, bit locker, something to do with

736
00:39:47,483 --> 00:39:49,166
bit locker. Bit star.

737
00:39:49,450 --> 00:39:49,466
>> Bit star.

738
00:39:49,483 --> 00:39:53,466
>> And so that's kind of the model we're trying to go for is,

739
00:39:53,166 --> 00:39:55,216
you know, just sort of over here or sort of over there.

740
00:39:55,300 --> 00:39:58,166
Now, there are times when you need to be precise and you can

741
00:39:58,483 --> 00:40:00,433
be precise. And there are times when it's just sort of like over

742
00:40:00,483 --> 00:40:03,466
there is good enough. And by the way, when you need both, you'll

743
00:40:03,483 --> 00:40:06,466
see how we deal with that. Through something called minus what-if

744
00:40:06,483 --> 00:40:07,466
and minus confirm.

745
00:40:07,483 --> 00:40:11,466
>> Yeah, yeah, yeah. And so and Jeffrey what I need you to help

746
00:40:11,483 --> 00:40:13,466
me with is that is the...

747
00:40:13,483 --> 00:40:17,466
this is the one that seems to throw most people off.

748
00:40:18,483 --> 00:40:22,466
So a dash... da-da-da... means you have a parameter. And if

749
00:40:23,0 --> 00:40:26,166
it's followed by chihuahuas, that means you can put arguments

750
00:40:26,483 --> 00:40:29,350
on it and you get the value type of the argument, string, int

751
00:40:29,433 --> 00:40:31,466
that kind of thing. And if it's got binkies in there, you can

752
00:40:31,483 --> 00:40:34,466
take multiple arguments, separated by a comma. You see plenty

753
00:40:34,483 --> 00:40:37,466
of examples of us doing that. And if you're surrounded by these

754
00:40:37,483 --> 00:40:40,466
brackets, you don't have to... it's optional. You don't have

755
00:40:40,483 --> 00:40:42,433
to do it at all. But.

756
00:40:42,450 --> 00:40:42,466
>> But.

757
00:40:42,483 --> 00:40:44,466
>> There's something tricky here in this view.

758
00:40:44,483 --> 00:40:45,466
>> Yeah, isn't that cool?

759
00:40:45,483 --> 00:40:48,383
>> Let's look at this guy. Look at this dash name. This guy's...

760
00:40:48,466 --> 00:40:51,466
throws everybody off. So I don't have to type this in. I don't

761
00:40:51,483 --> 00:40:53,466
type anything in, because we all know that I can just run Get

762
00:40:53,483 --> 00:40:58,466
Service and get all of them. But if I'm using dash name and I

763
00:40:58,483 --> 00:41:02,466
want to specify a name of a service, like bits, what is it with

764
00:41:02,183 --> 00:41:04,466
these little duders inside here?

765
00:41:04,483 --> 00:41:07,466
>> Yeah, this is something we called positional parameters, okay?

766
00:41:07,483 --> 00:41:11,466
And so that means that if you just specify the value, you don't

767
00:41:11,483 --> 00:41:13,466
have to specify dash name.

768
00:41:13,483 --> 00:41:14,250
>> So...

769
00:41:15,450 --> 00:41:15,466
>> So...

770
00:41:15,483 --> 00:41:19,466
>> This makes so... watch. Get Service.

771
00:41:20,483 --> 00:41:21,466
I can do this.

772
00:41:22,483 --> 00:41:26,466
You might be saying, oh, I got to type a lot. Actually, you

773
00:41:26,483 --> 00:41:29,466
don't have to type a lot, but here's what positional means.

774
00:41:30,483 --> 00:41:34,466
If you're going to give me a bunch of names of services, you

775
00:41:34,483 --> 00:41:38,466
don't have to use dash name. See? Works the same way. Which means

776
00:41:38,483 --> 00:41:41,466
so those brackets around the parameter simply mean you don't

777
00:41:41,483 --> 00:41:43,466
have to use the parameter. But you got to give me the argument.

778
00:41:43,483 --> 00:41:44,466
That's what makes it...

779
00:41:45,333 --> 00:41:48,466
>> It gets even better, because now you can just type GSV.

780
00:41:48,483 --> 00:41:52,433
>> Oh, yeah. You can use the alias to even shorten it up even further.

781
00:41:52,450 --> 00:41:52,466
So watch.

782
00:41:52,483 --> 00:41:57,250
>> Do you want to go ahead and do it?

783
00:41:57,333 --> 00:41:57,400
>> Go ahead.

784
00:41:57,416 --> 00:41:57,433
>> GSV...

785
00:41:57,450 --> 00:41:57,466
>> Bits....

786
00:41:57,483 --> 00:41:58,200
>> bits.

787
00:41:58,283 --> 00:42:02,466
>> And so here's kind of a key kind of principle of PowerShell, okay.

788
00:42:02,483 --> 00:42:07,350
The principle is we want to have this very regular, very self-describing

789
00:42:07,483 --> 00:42:11,466
surface, okay. So when it's 3:00 in the morning and things didn't

790
00:42:11,483 --> 00:42:15,466
go the way you wanted to, and during some IT upgrade, and you

791
00:42:15,483 --> 00:42:20,466
bring up some script, you want that script to be absolutely readable.

792
00:42:20,483 --> 00:42:24,383
You want to know what's going on, okay. And so that's why PowerShell

793
00:42:24,466 --> 00:42:28,466
is very clear, you know. Get-Service-Name, et cetera. So that

794
00:42:28,483 --> 00:42:30,466
when you're reading it, you know exactly what's going on.

795
00:42:30,483 --> 00:42:34,466
On the other hand, when you're interactive, you can type that

796
00:42:34,483 --> 00:42:37,466
if you want. We make it easier to type that with things like

797
00:42:37,483 --> 00:42:40,466
tab completion. But sometimes, you just want to go, go, go, go, go.

798
00:42:40,483 --> 00:42:44,466
And so we have all these short cuts and aliases so that you can

799
00:42:44,483 --> 00:42:48,466
be very, very productive as a high speed, advanced, interactive user.

800
00:42:49,483 --> 00:42:52,466
But then when you go and write scripts, we encourage the more

801
00:42:52,483 --> 00:42:53,466
verbose style.

802
00:42:54,0 --> 00:42:56,466
>> As a matter of fact, just to emphasize on that a little bit

803
00:42:56,483 --> 00:42:59,466
further, so when you're writing scripts, this is the way that

804
00:42:59,483 --> 00:43:01,433
you're going to want to do it here in the top example.

805
00:43:01,483 --> 00:43:06,266
You're going to want to be very explanatory of what you're doing.

806
00:43:06,350 --> 00:43:09,466
But as Jeffrey was saying, when you're at the console, free reign.

807
00:43:09,483 --> 00:43:12,466
I mean, you can use aliases and shorten this up with the positional

808
00:43:13,0 --> 00:43:15,466
parameters so that you can quickly get things done. You're going

809
00:43:15,483 --> 00:43:18,466
to see examples of that today, because Jeffrey uses an awful

810
00:43:18,483 --> 00:43:22,466
lot of aliases, and I usually, because I'm getting ready to automate

811
00:43:23,483 --> 00:43:26,466
it, sometimes I just do the whole thing the first time through

812
00:43:26,483 --> 00:43:29,466
where I use all the parameters and all the arguments. So you

813
00:43:29,483 --> 00:43:33,466
can see that contrast between working quickly interactively with

814
00:43:33,483 --> 00:43:36,466
the short, you know, short versions and then the long versions

815
00:43:36,483 --> 00:43:38,466
that you're going to want to see in a script. But let me give

816
00:43:38,483 --> 00:43:41,466
you a hint and then we'll do another example and then take a

817
00:43:41,483 --> 00:43:45,466
look at how to work with all of this. Have you guys been hitting

818
00:43:45,483 --> 00:43:50,466
the tab key? Take your pinky, take your pinky. If you're a touch

819
00:43:50,483 --> 00:43:54,466
typist, this is probably not for you. But this pinky should...

820
00:43:54,483 --> 00:43:57,333
>> He's showing you the official flexes move.

821
00:43:57,416 --> 00:43:57,433
>> Yeah, yeah.

822
00:43:57,450 --> 00:43:57,466
>> Warm up.

823
00:43:57,483 --> 00:43:58,466
>> Want to make sure you stretch.

824
00:43:58,483 --> 00:43:59,433
>> Want to warm it up...

825
00:43:59,450 --> 00:43:59,466
>> Stretch it.

826
00:43:59,483 --> 00:44:00,466
>> In the beginning of every day.

827
00:44:00,483 --> 00:44:03,466
>> Stretch it, stretch the pinky. And you want this pinky to

828
00:44:03,483 --> 00:44:06,466
hover right over the tab key always, because what you want to

829
00:44:07,483 --> 00:44:09,466
do is, watch, get SE... I'm going to start hitting the tab key.

830
00:44:10,483 --> 00:44:12,466
Look, look, look, it starts going through the commandlets.

831
00:44:12,483 --> 00:44:15,0
I've got so many commandlets now, there's a lot of them to go through.

832
00:44:15,483 --> 00:44:18,466
There we go, wait a minute. Shift tab goes backwards. Watch, dash.

833
00:44:18,483 --> 00:44:21,466
I'm going to hit the tab key. It will cycle through the parameters

834
00:44:21,483 --> 00:44:23,466
for me. Oh, this is cool.

835
00:44:23,483 --> 00:44:26,266
>> Remember I said we'd make it easier to help type this stuff out?

836
00:44:26,350 --> 00:44:26,466
The that's what he's talking about.

837
00:44:26,483 --> 00:44:31,466
>> Yeah. And so look. In just about as many key strokes as doing,

838
00:44:31,483 --> 00:44:36,466
like, GSV bits, just a couple of more and I can bang this out

839
00:44:36,483 --> 00:44:40,183
and get it to look really nice and clean so that if I'm going

840
00:44:40,266 --> 00:44:43,466
to use this in a script. So the tab key is your friend. Use the

841
00:44:43,483 --> 00:44:46,183
tab key. You're going to see us use this all the time today.

842
00:44:46,266 --> 00:44:48,466
Let me show you another example of finding something as kind

843
00:44:48,483 --> 00:44:52,466
of a summary here of finding a commandlet and then taking a look

844
00:44:52,483 --> 00:44:53,466
at its syntax.

845
00:44:54,483 --> 00:44:56,466
Then we're going to show you how to put commandlets together

846
00:44:56,483 --> 00:44:58,466
on the pipeline. So let's do this.

847
00:44:59,483 --> 00:45:02,466
I have this business problem. Business problem time. And my

848
00:45:02,483 --> 00:45:05,466
business problem is I need to get...

849
00:45:06,483 --> 00:45:09,466
I need some errors.

850
00:45:10,483 --> 00:45:12,166
I need the newest errors.

851
00:45:12,483 --> 00:45:15,466
The newest five errors out of my system log.

852
00:45:15,483 --> 00:45:16,466
>> Oh, yeah.

853
00:45:16,483 --> 00:45:18,183
>> So I need to be able to look at my event...

854
00:45:18,266 --> 00:45:18,466
>> Log file.

855
00:45:18,483 --> 00:45:19,433
>> Yeah, the log file.

856
00:45:19,450 --> 00:45:19,466
>> Yeah.

857
00:45:19,483 --> 00:45:22,466
>> So I'm thinking I need to look at my event logs. I wonder

858
00:45:22,483 --> 00:45:27,466
if PowerShell has a commandlet that can help me with my event log.

859
00:45:27,483 --> 00:45:29,283
So Get Help star.

860
00:45:30,300 --> 00:45:32,200
Well, let's see, do you have anything with event logs?

861
00:45:32,483 --> 00:45:36,466
Oh, and lo and behold, there are plenty. As a matter of fact,

862
00:45:36,483 --> 00:45:39,183
this is a great time now, you can take a look at the verbs.

863
00:45:39,483 --> 00:45:42,466
You can just guess what do you think clear event log is going

864
00:45:42,483 --> 00:45:43,466
to do.

865
00:45:43,483 --> 00:45:44,466
>> That would clear it.

866
00:45:44,483 --> 00:45:47,466
>> I bet it would clear it too. You know what do you think get

867
00:45:48,483 --> 00:45:52,233
event log is going to do? Ta-da. It's going to... I know it

868
00:45:52,316 --> 00:45:55,266
seems ridiculous, but this is the point is you're looking at

869
00:45:55,350 --> 00:45:57,416
the verbs and figuring out what they're going to do and it's

870
00:45:57,483 --> 00:46:00,466
not that difficult at this point. Now what we're going to do

871
00:46:00,483 --> 00:46:03,466
is I want to get an event log. Now, I could just try to run this,

872
00:46:03,483 --> 00:46:05,466
but I want to take a look at the help file first, so I'm going

873
00:46:06,483 --> 00:46:07,466
to do Get Help on Get Event Log,

874
00:46:09,483 --> 00:46:12,466
and I want to take a look at the syntax, and I also, if I have

875
00:46:12,483 --> 00:46:14,466
questions about the parameters, I want to be able to see the

876
00:46:14,483 --> 00:46:17,466
definitions of those parameters. So I'm going to do dash detailed

877
00:46:17,483 --> 00:46:21,466
right now. And I'm going to go up here and go, hey, here's Get

878
00:46:21,483 --> 00:46:22,466
Event Log.

879
00:46:23,483 --> 00:46:27,466
Take a look at the syntax. Look. Get Event Log. Look at all

880
00:46:27,483 --> 00:46:30,466
of these parameters. See the dashes? See the arguments that they

881
00:46:30,483 --> 00:46:33,466
can have, whether they can have multiple values? And if you don't

882
00:46:33,483 --> 00:46:37,466
know what something is, like, hm, I wonder what newest means,

883
00:46:38,483 --> 00:46:40,466
you can scroll down and you can take a look down here. And the

884
00:46:40,483 --> 00:46:43,466
reason I'm going through this is this is what we all have...

885
00:46:43,483 --> 00:46:46,466
end up doing is I don't know necessarily what all the parameters

886
00:46:46,483 --> 00:46:49,466
mean so a lot of times I go to the list and I read the list of

887
00:46:49,483 --> 00:46:54,400
parameters first, just to find out what capabilities I have.

888
00:46:54,483 --> 00:46:56,466
I know that seems like it may take a few extra minutes, but it's

889
00:46:56,483 --> 00:47:01,466
worth it because I found that newest means I can get the newest

890
00:47:01,483 --> 00:47:04,466
entries in the log. But also take a look at something else in

891
00:47:04,483 --> 00:47:06,466
this syntax. Oops, where did it go?

892
00:47:07,483 --> 00:47:10,466
Look at all of the things that are optional. But I want you

893
00:47:10,483 --> 00:47:12,466
to notice something. Looky up here.

894
00:47:13,483 --> 00:47:18,466
I want you to notice that dash log name isn't required, but this

895
00:47:18,483 --> 00:47:19,466
guy is.

896
00:47:20,183 --> 00:47:23,466
I want you to see what happens when something is mandatory and

897
00:47:23,483 --> 00:47:26,466
you try to run it. So if I just tried to run get ept log, I want

898
00:47:26,483 --> 00:47:29,466
you to think about this. If this worked just like this, think

899
00:47:29,483 --> 00:47:32,400
about all of the... it's going to go through all of the logs

900
00:47:32,483 --> 00:47:36,466
and spit all of the logs out on to my screen. Could that be

901
00:47:36,483 --> 00:47:40,416
a little performance issue, especially if you're doing it to

902
00:47:40,483 --> 00:47:42,183
50 machines at once?

903
00:47:42,266 --> 00:47:43,466
>> That's now called big data.

904
00:47:44,483 --> 00:47:45,466
>> That's right, big data.

905
00:47:45,483 --> 00:47:46,466
>> Big data.

906
00:47:47,483 --> 00:47:48,466
>> Big data.

907
00:47:49,483 --> 00:47:53,466
So watch. I'm going to strike enter and PowerShell is smart enough

908
00:47:53,483 --> 00:47:57,466
to go hey, look, you need to know what log you want to look in.

909
00:47:57,200 --> 00:47:59,466
So we're going to make you tell us what log.

910
00:48:00,483 --> 00:48:02,466
So I'm going to say system. Now, of course, it's now going to

911
00:48:02,483 --> 00:48:06,466
give me the entire system log, but let me just show you by using

912
00:48:06,483 --> 00:48:10,466
the Help file, looking at the examples, reading the parameters,

913
00:48:10,200 --> 00:48:14,466
you can start to make solutions like this. Get Event Log I know

914
00:48:14,183 --> 00:48:17,466
wants a log name. I want the log name system. I also know that

915
00:48:17,483 --> 00:48:19,466
I want the newest...

916
00:48:19,233 --> 00:48:20,466
>> Wait. I think you can tab complete that too.

917
00:48:22,316 --> 00:48:24,466
>> I think you can now too. Yes. Wait a minute, let's try it.

918
00:48:25,0 --> 00:48:28,466
Didn't used to be able to do that. Let's see. Oh, look.

919
00:48:28,216 --> 00:48:28,466
>> Is that cool?

920
00:48:28,483 --> 00:48:31,466
>> That is totally cool. I noticed that a lot in V3, that you

921
00:48:32,0 --> 00:48:34,433
can now tab complete on a lot of the things that the system has.

922
00:48:34,450 --> 00:48:34,466
>> Yeah.

923
00:48:34,483 --> 00:48:36,466
>> I think another reason you should be using V3.

924
00:48:37,483 --> 00:48:40,466
>> Yeah, right. That's a V3-ism, not a V2-ism.

925
00:48:40,216 --> 00:48:43,466
>> Yeah. So I know that by looking at the Help file that newest

926
00:48:43,483 --> 00:48:46,450
will let me get the newest... I'm just going to say three entries.

927
00:48:46,483 --> 00:48:49,0
But here's the thing. You guys know this, in a log file there's

928
00:48:49,483 --> 00:48:52,283
a lot of that information stuff, and I don't want that.

929
00:48:52,366 --> 00:48:54,466
Just so happens if you look at the Help file, you'll find that

930
00:48:54,483 --> 00:48:55,466
entry type

931
00:48:57,216 --> 00:49:01,466
error, that's going to give me the three latest errors.

932
00:49:01,233 --> 00:49:03,466
Now, you might be thinking to yourself, well, that's not...

933
00:49:03,483 --> 00:49:06,466
you know, that's cool, but I had to do a lot of reading. I could

934
00:49:06,483 --> 00:49:11,466
have just opened up, you know, the graphical for this. Oh, yeah?

935
00:49:11,483 --> 00:49:12,466
Well, watch this.

936
00:49:14,183 --> 00:49:15,466
Thing is this.

937
00:49:16,483 --> 00:49:18,466
There's a parameter in here called computer name. I want the

938
00:49:18,483 --> 00:49:23,466
latest three errors from three different computers.

939
00:49:25,483 --> 00:49:30,333
Here's the thing you need to kind of get from all of this.

940
00:49:30,416 --> 00:49:35,466
You can't open the graphical fast enough, more or less get that

941
00:49:35,483 --> 00:49:36,466
data that quick.

942
00:49:37,483 --> 00:49:44,266
So in this one command that I figured out, I can get errors from

943
00:49:44,350 --> 00:49:49,466
multiple computers on my display. Now, it's on my display, and

944
00:49:49,483 --> 00:49:52,466
we're going to fix that here in this next section, because maybe

945
00:49:52,166 --> 00:49:55,466
I don't want it on my display. Maybe I want it, I don't know,

946
00:49:55,483 --> 00:49:56,466
in a web page.

947
00:49:57,483 --> 00:50:00,466
Or a CSV or something like that but...

948
00:50:00,483 --> 00:50:02,466
>> They missed the look. Show that again.

949
00:50:02,216 --> 00:50:10,466
>> Ooh, a web page. I turned to Jeffrey and go ooh. So I've used

950
00:50:10,483 --> 00:50:13,466
the Help file to build one great command and now we want to start

951
00:50:13,483 --> 00:50:17,466
doing more with it. So to kind of wrap this up here, I've got

952
00:50:17,483 --> 00:50:19,466
some slides in here, and like I said, everything that we've been

953
00:50:19,483 --> 00:50:23,466
doing is in the slide deck so let me just kind of thumb through

954
00:50:23,483 --> 00:50:24,466
here the slides. So again, questions?

955
00:50:25,483 --> 00:50:26,433
>> By the way, you missed something crucial.

956
00:50:26,450 --> 00:50:26,466
>> Did I?

957
00:50:26,483 --> 00:50:27,466
>> Yeah.

958
00:50:27,483 --> 00:50:28,466
>> What did I miss?

959
00:50:28,483 --> 00:50:32,366
>> Go back to... go back to that wildcard help. Interactive.

960
00:50:33,450 --> 00:50:33,466
>> Which...

961
00:50:33,483 --> 00:50:35,283
>> Oh, good Lord. Go to mine.

962
00:50:35,366 --> 00:50:36,233
>> Fine, fine.

963
00:50:37,483 --> 00:50:41,366
>> He said Get Help, help, star event log.

964
00:50:42,483 --> 00:50:46,466
And pointed out, oh, look here, you got clear, you got get, limit.

965
00:50:46,483 --> 00:50:48,466
But look here. About.

966
00:50:48,483 --> 00:50:51,233
>> Oh, I forgot to talk about the About Help.

967
00:50:51,316 --> 00:50:54,333
>> No, this is like one of the most important things. It's About

968
00:50:54,483 --> 00:50:58,466
Event Logs okay? So these are what we call conceptual topics, okay?

969
00:50:58,483 --> 00:51:01,466
So you say, okay, clear screen and then... by the way, here's

970
00:51:01,483 --> 00:51:04,466
a trick I do, right. So if I did clear screen. Here's the thing.

971
00:51:05,483 --> 00:51:07,466
So now I want to see this. If I do clear screen and then, oh,

972
00:51:07,483 --> 00:51:09,466
what was it I was going to do? Oh, shoot.

973
00:51:10,483 --> 00:51:15,466
All right. Because again, I'm flawed, right? I can't... about something.

974
00:51:15,483 --> 00:51:19,216
Okay. So here, so what you do is you do clear screen and then semicolon.

975
00:51:19,300 --> 00:51:24,466
Semicolon is a statement separator that says do this and then

976
00:51:24,483 --> 00:51:27,366
do something else. So it's a way to do two things at once.

977
00:51:27,450 --> 00:51:32,466
Then I'm going to say get... I'll just say help, about event...

978
00:51:32,483 --> 00:51:37,200
by the way, tab return. Event logs. So then it clears the screen

979
00:51:37,283 --> 00:51:41,333
and shows me About. So here notice it gives me a short description,

980
00:51:41,450 --> 00:51:45,466
describes things, viewing the event logs, goes through the discussion

981
00:51:46,183 --> 00:51:49,466
about the topic. Tells you about the commands, et cetera.

982
00:51:49,483 --> 00:51:53,466
And so there's quite a bit here. And then clear screen. If you

983
00:51:53,483 --> 00:51:56,466
just say help, about underscore star...

984
00:51:56,483 --> 00:51:58,466
>> Yeah, that's, there you go.

985
00:51:58,483 --> 00:52:03,200
>> You'll see lots of About topics. Look at them. There's a...

986
00:52:03,283 --> 00:52:07,266
and there's just a ton of really good stuff here. Like wildcards.

987
00:52:07,350 --> 00:52:10,466
Hey, About Wildcards. About Wildcards.

988
00:52:11,483 --> 00:52:14,466
About PowerShell Version 4. Guess which one I'm using.

989
00:52:14,483 --> 00:52:19,400
About the ISE, About W My and there's the one I mentioned, remember,

990
00:52:19,483 --> 00:52:20,433
About WQL...

991
00:52:20,450 --> 00:52:20,466
>> Yeah.

992
00:52:20,483 --> 00:52:23,466
>> So, so I got to tell you, this is one of the best investments

993
00:52:24,166 --> 00:52:28,466
you can make is to go and do this Help About and spend some time

994
00:52:28,483 --> 00:52:31,433
reading them. I mean, there's really great stuff there.

995
00:52:31,483 --> 00:52:34,333
>> Yeah, and I think, I think the important side to this is that

996
00:52:34,416 --> 00:52:38,433
there's actually two Help systems. The Help will help you discover

997
00:52:38,483 --> 00:52:41,466
out of both of them. You've got Help system for the commandlets

998
00:52:41,483 --> 00:52:44,466
and then you have this About_Help system, which, as Jeffrey just

999
00:52:44,483 --> 00:52:47,466
said, is conceptual stuff. As we go through today, we're going

1000
00:52:47,483 --> 00:52:50,466
to be pointing out, oh, yeah, you need more information, go to

1001
00:52:50,483 --> 00:52:52,466
the about underscore, blah, blah, blah, blah, and there will

1002
00:52:52,483 --> 00:52:54,466
be more information in it.

1003
00:52:54,483 --> 00:52:55,466
>> No, there's more than that.

1004
00:52:55,483 --> 00:52:56,466
>> What's more than that?

1005
00:52:56,483 --> 00:52:58,283
>> Oh, so you don't know about Category?

1006
00:52:58,483 --> 00:52:59,466
>> Category?

1007
00:52:59,483 --> 00:53:04,466
>> Yeah. So Get Help plus Category, and here's the trick, right.

1008
00:53:04,483 --> 00:53:08,466
So you say that I know that Category takes up value, but I don't

1009
00:53:08,483 --> 00:53:11,250
know what value it is, right? And so sometimes we have to have

1010
00:53:11,333 --> 00:53:13,466
completion, sometimes we don't. Here's what I have to do. I just

1011
00:53:13,483 --> 00:53:17,433
like give a bad value and then often what it will do is it will

1012
00:53:17,450 --> 00:53:17,466
tell you...

1013
00:53:18,483 --> 00:53:19,466
>> Come up and tell you what categories?

1014
00:53:19,483 --> 00:53:23,466
>> The argument, blah, blah, blah does not belong to the set and

1015
00:53:23,483 --> 00:53:25,466
it tells you the set of things that you can type.

1016
00:53:26,333 --> 00:53:29,466
>> Oh, so you can get specifically for, like, the providers we're

1017
00:53:29,483 --> 00:53:30,366
going to be talking about?

1018
00:53:30,450 --> 00:53:33,466
>> That's the key. I'll tell you here, we did this and set this

1019
00:53:33,483 --> 00:53:36,466
up, and we had quite ambitious things for the Help subsystem,

1020
00:53:36,483 --> 00:53:39,466
and we haven't fully implemented all of them. Some of our partners

1021
00:53:40,333 --> 00:53:42,466
have implemented some of them, but we didn't. Like we were going

1022
00:53:42,483 --> 00:53:46,466
to have FAQs and glossary terms. So if you say Help FAQ, it's

1023
00:53:46,483 --> 00:53:50,466
not there. Okay? Like to get around to that. But in particular,

1024
00:53:50,483 --> 00:53:55,466
notice here, it says... where did... provider, right? So what

1025
00:53:56,0 --> 00:53:56,466
you can do is you can say...

1026
00:53:58,483 --> 00:54:01,466
by the way, tab works.

1027
00:54:01,483 --> 00:54:02,466
>> There you go.

1028
00:54:03,166 --> 00:54:05,466
>> It tells you, oh, look here are the various providers.

1029
00:54:06,166 --> 00:54:08,233
Now, we're going to talk about this topic later.

1030
00:54:08,316 --> 00:54:08,466
>> Right.

1031
00:54:08,483 --> 00:54:11,183
>> But if you did that and you said, oh, Get Help

1032
00:54:13,483 --> 00:54:19,433
Certificate, certificate, cer, tiff, tiff, tiff.

1033
00:54:19,450 --> 00:54:19,466
>> Tificate.

1034
00:54:19,483 --> 00:54:20,466
>> It will

1035
00:54:22,183 --> 00:54:24,466
give you information about a provider. When we get to the topic

1036
00:54:24,483 --> 00:54:27,466
about providers, this will make more sense. But it's a very,

1037
00:54:27,483 --> 00:54:28,466
very rich Help system.

1038
00:54:28,483 --> 00:54:30,466
>> Yeah, very rich Help system.
