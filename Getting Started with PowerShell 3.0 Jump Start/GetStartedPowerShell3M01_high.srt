00:00:00,333 --> 00:00:06,333
[Music]

00:00:23,483 --> 00:00:24,466
with PowerShell.

5
00:00:24,483 --> 00:00:25,466
>> The best one.

6
00:00:25,483 --> 00:00:26,466
>> It's going to be the best one.

>> The best one ever.

8
00:00:27,233 --> 00:00:29,466
>> Of getting started with PowerShell. Whether you are an IT

9
00:00:29,483 --> 00:00:33,466
pro or even a dev this is the strongest most powerful management

10
00:00:33,483 --> 00:00:35,466
tool you have in your arsenal to take control of your network.

11
00:00:35,483 --> 00:00:38,433
And we are going to take you through today step by step.

12
00:00:38,483 --> 00:00:42,466
And when I say we, well it's a very special training event today.

13
00:00:42,483 --> 00:00:47,300
I am Jason Jason Helmick, but this is the inventor of PowerShell,

14
00:00:47,483 --> 00:00:49,466
distinguished engineer, Jeffrey Snover.

15
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:50,450
>> Howdy.

16
00:00:50,483 --> 00:00:54,283
>> And this is going to be a great even for all of us today.

17
00:00:54,366 --> 00:00:57,466
We are going to take you step by step on how to get started working

18
00:00:57,483 --> 00:01:01,466
with PowerShell and who better to learn it from than Jeffrey Snover.

19
00:01:01,483 --> 00:01:04,166
So I tell you what Jeffrey let's start out with some intro.

20
00:01:04,450 --> 00:01:04,466
>> Sure.

21
00:01:04,483 --> 00:01:06,466
>> I will flip the little slide thing.

22
00:01:07,483 --> 00:01:11,250
>> So howdy, I am Jeffrey Snover. I am a distinguished engineer

23
00:01:11,333 --> 00:01:16,466
and I started off the PowerShell team about twelve years ago,

24
00:01:16,483 --> 00:01:20,466
maybe a little bit more, and that worked out pretty well because

25
00:01:20,483 --> 00:01:24,333
after having shipped a couple of versions they made me a distinguished engineer.

26
00:01:24,416 --> 00:01:28,466
And then the lead architect for Windows Server 2012.

27
00:01:28,483 --> 00:01:29,200
>> Awesome.

28
00:01:29,283 --> 00:01:31,466
>> And that worked out pretty well. So now I am the lead architect

29
00:01:31,483 --> 00:01:34,466
for Windows Server and System Center Data Center products.

30
00:01:34,483 --> 00:01:37,333
So I am having some fun.

31
00:01:37,416 --> 00:01:40,466
>> Oh boy, having a lot of fun. And with PowerShell and what we

32
00:01:40,183 --> 00:01:42,166
are going to talk about, the Windows Management framework, all

33
00:01:42,483 --> 00:01:45,300
of this bundled together. It's not just in server 2012, but it

34
00:01:45,383 --> 00:01:49,466
works all the way backwards to 2003 so that we can do all of

35
00:01:50,0 --> 00:01:52,466
this management with everything that we have in our environment,

36
00:01:52,483 --> 00:01:54,466
not just necessarily the latest and greatest.

37
00:01:54,483 --> 00:01:57,183
>> That's the plan. We are back to filling up your arsenal.

38
00:01:57,266 --> 00:01:57,466
I like that term.

39
00:01:57,483 --> 00:02:00,466
>> I like that term too. That's turning out pretty good. So let

40
00:02:00,483 --> 00:02:03,466
me tell you a little bit about myself. I am Jason Helmick and

41
00:02:03,483 --> 00:02:06,466
I work with Concentrated Technologies. I do this for a living.

42
00:02:06,483 --> 00:02:09,466
I love to train on PowerShell and I also work as an engineer

43
00:02:10,483 --> 00:02:13,466
and a consultant mainly doing a lot of automation with it.

44
00:02:13,483 --> 00:02:15,466
I am the author of a new book that's coming out

45
00:02:17,483 --> 00:02:22,466
Windows IIS in a Month of Lunches, tough title to say. And it's

46
00:02:22,483 --> 00:02:26,466
not only about learning IIS, but it's using PowerShell for it.

47
00:02:26,483 --> 00:02:30,466
So, just some interesting little tidbits about me, truly what

48
00:02:30,483 --> 00:02:33,466
the best thing to know about me is that I get to sit next to

49
00:02:33,483 --> 00:02:37,466
him as we do this. So this is going to be a lot of fun.

50
00:02:37,483 --> 00:02:41,333
Let's start off with showing you what we are going to talk about today.

51
00:02:41,483 --> 00:02:44,200
So as you can see from the agenda we are going to cover several

52
00:02:44,283 --> 00:02:46,466
topics today and it's actually quite a few of them. We are going

53
00:02:46,483 --> 00:02:49,466
to start off with one of my favorite ones which is "Don't Fear

54
00:02:49,483 --> 00:02:53,466
the Shell". I think a lot of IT guys, when they first get started

55
00:02:53,483 --> 00:02:57,466
with this, I hear this all the time, and they are scared to get

56
00:02:57,483 --> 00:02:58,433
started with PowerShell.

57
00:02:58,450 --> 00:02:58,466
>> Yeah.

58
00:02:58,483 --> 00:03:00,450
>> They are not used to a command line. They don't want to say

59
00:03:00,483 --> 00:03:03,466
they ware scared, but they are not used to using a command line.

60
00:03:03,483 --> 00:03:07,466
>> Deep down they see that console window and they are just like, "Ah".

61
00:03:07,483 --> 00:03:08,466
>> I don't know what to do.

62
00:03:08,483 --> 00:03:10,400
>> Deer in the headlights.

63
00:03:10,483 --> 00:03:12,466
>> So one of the first things we are going to want to do is get

64
00:03:13,0 --> 00:03:15,466
rid of some of that fear. Show you how straightforward you can

65
00:03:15,483 --> 00:03:18,466
get started with PowerShell. And then we are going to take you

66
00:03:18,483 --> 00:03:21,466
into what PowerShell starts to look like. And then of course

67
00:03:21,483 --> 00:03:23,466
we are going to talk about the reasons why PowerShell even exists.

68
00:03:23,483 --> 00:03:27,466
And there are some incredibly important ones. We will also get

69
00:03:27,483 --> 00:03:29,466
into the help system. That's probably one of the most important

70
00:03:29,483 --> 00:03:33,216
things that we do today and the pipeline and extending the shell.

71
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:35,333
All of this stuff that we are going to do is going to make more

72
00:03:35,416 --> 00:03:38,466
sense as we hit it. Looking at what objects are and drilling

73
00:03:38,483 --> 00:03:41,466
into the pipeline. What is that weird character I keep seeing

74
00:03:41,483 --> 00:03:44,466
between these commands? And we will get into one of the most

75
00:03:44,483 --> 00:03:49,366
important advantages that you have which will be PowerShell remoting,

76
00:03:49,450 --> 00:03:51,466
which will let you do a lot of your stuff in scale.

77
00:03:51,483 --> 00:03:52,466
>> That's where it get's fun.

78
00:03:52,483 --> 00:03:54,266
>> That's where it really get's fun.

79
00:03:54,350 --> 00:03:57,466
>> By the way, so people should be doing these exercises with us.

80
00:03:57,483 --> 00:04:01,466
So you should be at your computer, fire up a PowerShell window

81
00:04:01,483 --> 00:04:04,466
and type along with us. That's the way you get the most out of

82
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,466
this course.

83
00:04:05,483 --> 00:04:08,466
>> And actually I think that's the best way to get the most out

84
00:04:08,483 --> 00:04:11,466
of this. I know you want to kickback and kind of sip some coffee

85
00:04:11,483 --> 00:04:13,466
or whatever and listen to us, but keep your fingers close to

86
00:04:13,483 --> 00:04:17,266
that keyboard and that console and PowerShell so you can work

87
00:04:17,350 --> 00:04:17,466
with us on this.

88
00:04:17,483 --> 00:04:20,466
>> And you should be, well are you going to tell them about the Q&A?

89
00:04:20,483 --> 00:04:22,466
>> Yeah, yeah, as a matter of fact I have got a slide coming up.

90
00:04:23,0 --> 00:04:26,233
Oh here, let's do the expectations things on our target audience

91
00:04:26,316 --> 00:04:30,466
and then we will talk about how to join us. This was designed

92
00:04:30,483 --> 00:04:35,466
for IT pros, however if you are a dev please join us on this.

93
00:04:35,483 --> 00:04:39,466
This was designed for IT pros to be quick deep dive and get started

94
00:04:39,483 --> 00:04:42,466
with PowerShell. There are so many guys and gals out there right

95
00:04:42,483 --> 00:04:46,466
now who are trying to get started with PowerShell and sometimes

96
00:04:46,483 --> 00:04:48,466
you find it really difficult. Well these are these ideas to get

97
00:04:48,483 --> 00:04:51,466
you through the difficulty. And we are not just doing an introductory

98
00:04:51,483 --> 00:04:54,466
level, we are going to go in pretty deep with using PowerShell.

99
00:04:54,483 --> 00:04:56,466
And it doesn't matter what product you want to use it with.

100
00:04:57,483 --> 00:04:59,466
Whether you want to use it with Active Directory or SharePoint

101
00:04:59,483 --> 00:05:01,466
you have got to know the tool and if you know the tool then the

102
00:05:01,483 --> 00:05:05,466
products are easy to deal with. So if you are an IT pro, if you

103
00:05:05,483 --> 00:05:08,466
work in help desk, if you are a developer interested in what

104
00:05:08,483 --> 00:05:13,0
PowerShell can do for you this is the place to be. And as a

105
00:05:13,483 --> 00:05:15,466
couple of additional resources first of all we have chat available.

106
00:05:15,483 --> 00:05:18,466
If you are all in on chat you can chat us questions and I will

107
00:05:18,483 --> 00:05:22,466
constantly be reminding you to chat in questions. We have an

108
00:05:22,483 --> 00:05:27,316
amazing support staff out there today. A lot of the PowerShell

109
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:30,466
MVP's are joining us today to help answer questions and we will

110
00:05:30,483 --> 00:05:33,466
be out there answering questions. So we want you to joint in,

111
00:05:33,483 --> 00:05:36,466
contribute and ask whatever questions you have. And we will

112
00:05:36,166 --> 00:05:38,466
do the best we can to make sure you all get an answer to it.

113
00:05:38,483 --> 00:05:42,466
>> And the PowerShell community is blessed with some fantastic MVP's.

114
00:05:42,483 --> 00:05:46,466
A number of which are online and they will be coming and going

115
00:05:46,483 --> 00:05:49,466
throughout the day. So don't hesitate to ask questions. You have

116
00:05:49,483 --> 00:05:51,466
some rock stars out there.

117
00:05:51,483 --> 00:05:54,466
>> You certainly do. And I also want you to keep in mind that

118
00:05:54,483 --> 00:05:58,200
this particular virtual academy we are going to have a second

119
00:05:58,283 --> 00:06:01,466
session, not the same thing, we are going to go beyond this session

120
00:06:01,483 --> 00:06:04,0
further and further into scripting and tool making here in just

121
00:06:04,483 --> 00:06:05,466
a couple of weeks on August first, right.

122
00:06:05,483 --> 00:06:07,466
>> Yeah, yeah.

123
00:06:07,483 --> 00:06:11,183
>> So you want to join the MVA community. As a matter of fact

124
00:06:11,266 --> 00:06:15,466
you can join the MVA community, get signed in online and as you

125
00:06:16,166 --> 00:06:20,466
go through the videos available out there you get points and

126
00:06:20,483 --> 00:06:24,283
for right now you can get 50 special MVA points if you put in

127
00:06:24,366 --> 00:06:28,316
the code that's at the bottom of the screen. So make sure you

128
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:30,466
keep track of what's going on with the MVA community so that

129
00:06:30,483 --> 00:06:35,466
you can get more sessions just like this one. I don't know do

130
00:06:35,483 --> 00:06:37,466
you think we are ready to maybe get started?

131
00:06:37,483 --> 00:06:38,166
>> Yeah, let's go.

132
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:38,466
>> Let's get into this.

133
00:06:38,483 --> 00:06:39,466
>> My favorite topic.

134
00:06:39,483 --> 00:06:42,466
>> I know and I just love talking about this. So folks, here

135
00:06:42,483 --> 00:06:46,266
we go, we are going to get into "Don't Fear the Shell".

136
00:06:46,350 --> 00:06:49,466
Come on, you can hear the music right. Don't fear the shell,

137
00:06:49,483 --> 00:06:50,433
duh nuh nuh, okay maybe not.

138
00:06:50,450 --> 00:06:50,466
>> Uh, no.

139
00:06:50,483 --> 00:06:51,466
>> Okay, maybe not.

140
00:06:52,483 --> 00:06:53,466
We will stop that then.

141
00:06:54,483 --> 00:06:56,466
So look we are going to go through and overview of what PowerShell

142
00:06:56,483 --> 00:06:58,466
is and why it even exists. And of course this is a great time

143
00:06:58,483 --> 00:07:02,250
for Jeffrey to help us understand why we even have this.

144
00:07:02,333 --> 00:07:04,466
And then we are going to start going into how to take some of

145
00:07:04,483 --> 00:07:06,466
the fear out of running PowerShell. We will show you how to

146
00:07:07,483 --> 00:07:10,466
get it installed and how to get it set up. So, let's rock and roll.

147
00:07:10,483 --> 00:07:13,166
First of all, the purpose to PowerShell, I just want to point

148
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:14,316
out, do you see this slide?

149
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:14,466
>> Yeah.

150
00:07:14,483 --> 00:07:18,466
>> You are, so see the "you" and the "them"? That picture of you,

151
00:07:18,483 --> 00:07:22,466
that's a picture of me when I was younger. I swear to, no, it's

152
00:07:22,483 --> 00:07:26,283
not really a picture of me. So here's the idea: you are sitting

153
00:07:26,366 --> 00:07:29,466
there struggling with the day to day events of everything that's

154
00:07:29,483 --> 00:07:32,466
around you. You have got projects that you have to have to have done.

155
00:07:32,483 --> 00:07:35,0
There are things that are on fire and everything is going on

156
00:07:35,483 --> 00:07:38,466
and then you have them. Your end users, your boss, all of these

157
00:07:38,483 --> 00:07:42,466
people that are like, "We need this now, we need this now" and

158
00:07:42,483 --> 00:07:45,466
in Microsoft environments this has been a challenge. We have

159
00:07:46,483 --> 00:07:49,466
had some tools and you have had some scripting languages and

160
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:53,466
we had VBScript, but there were certain limitations that would

161
00:07:53,483 --> 00:07:57,466
challenge us and it wasn't quite complete enough. It was also

162
00:07:57,483 --> 00:08:02,300
kind of hard and doing automation and solving problems was a

163
00:08:02,383 --> 00:08:03,466
huge challenge.

164
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:10,466
Then came a long this product that you made. So why is it, what

165
00:08:10,483 --> 00:08:12,466
is it that you were trying to solve for all of us guys in IT?

166
00:08:12,483 --> 00:08:16,466
>> Yeah, you know when I came to the company I said, "We need

167
00:08:16,483 --> 00:08:19,466
an automation strategy" and they said, "Well, we have an automation

168
00:08:19,216 --> 00:08:23,466
strategy" and I said, "Really, where?" and they said, "Well,

169
00:08:23,183 --> 00:08:26,466
here" and it was VBScript. I was like, "No, my friends, that's

170
00:08:26,483 --> 00:08:29,466
not an automation strategy". Then they would say, "Well here,

171
00:08:29,483 --> 00:08:32,466
have got these great API's" and I was like, "No my friend that's

172
00:08:32,483 --> 00:08:34,166
not automation strategy".

173
00:08:34,483 --> 00:08:35,466
>> Oh, I don't even like the sound of that.

174
00:08:35,483 --> 00:08:40,383
>> Exactly and so what I knew was that we needed to have an interactive

175
00:08:40,466 --> 00:08:43,466
shell, an environment that someone would say, "Hey, go explore

176
00:08:43,483 --> 00:08:47,466
the system, try this, try that, try that and be able to get things done".

177
00:08:47,483 --> 00:08:52,466
Then from there the idea is that I notice that I type the things

178
00:08:52,483 --> 00:08:56,466
over and over again why don't I put it in a script and then just

179
00:08:56,483 --> 00:09:01,466
run it from there. Then say, "Well that's great, it's reduced

180
00:09:01,483 --> 00:09:05,333
my repetitive strain injury now I would like to parameterize it".

181
00:09:05,483 --> 00:09:08,466
Oh, so I would like to parameterize it, now I can use it for

182
00:09:08,483 --> 00:09:11,466
a wide arrange of things and now I would like to share it with you.

183
00:09:11,483 --> 00:09:14,466
And now we would like to use it to manage thousands of machines.

184
00:09:14,483 --> 00:09:18,466
So we had this model and we called it the Admin Development Model,

185
00:09:19,0 --> 00:09:24,466
which really Bruce, super star Bruce, says the average lifetime

186
00:09:24,483 --> 00:09:28,466
of command line scrip, or sorry of a script, starts at the prompt

187
00:09:28,483 --> 00:09:32,466
and ends at the character turn. It was very important that it

188
00:09:32,216 --> 00:09:35,466
be an interactive environment so that you can explore and honestly

189
00:09:35,483 --> 00:09:38,466
have fun. I mean if there are two things you get out of today's

190
00:09:38,483 --> 00:09:43,466
session: one is a spirit of exploration. Hey this is a great

191
00:09:43,483 --> 00:09:46,400
environment to go explore, explore, explore and then two just

192
00:09:46,483 --> 00:09:49,466
how much fun it is. I mean it's just a blast to be able to use.

193
00:09:50,483 --> 00:09:54,466
Then from there to be able to automate, you know, automate, automate, automate.

194
00:09:55,483 --> 00:09:59,200
If we had just transformed a click, click, click experience to

195
00:09:59,283 --> 00:10:02,466
a click, click, experience then okay that's good, lots of people

196
00:10:03,333 --> 00:10:08,166
prefer this over this, but you really wouldn't have transformed

197
00:10:08,483 --> 00:10:11,466
the platform. It's the ability to then do this, this and this

198
00:10:11,483 --> 00:10:13,333
and then say, "Save

199
00:10:14,483 --> 00:10:16,466
and then just click and run".

200
00:10:16,483 --> 00:10:21,166
>> And I just want to emphasize that we are unaccustomed in Windows

201
00:10:21,483 --> 00:10:25,466
environments of having an interactive shell a real time solve

202
00:10:25,483 --> 00:10:28,166
your problem tool. I mean we have always had basic commands,

203
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:31,466
but that really wasn't solving our problem. This means solve

204
00:10:31,483 --> 00:10:36,466
your problem and then literally copy, paste or hit save and now

205
00:10:36,483 --> 00:10:38,433
you can automate it.

206
00:10:38,450 --> 00:10:38,466
>> Exactly.

207
00:10:39,483 --> 00:10:43,466
>> And it doesn't require any more then have fun finding and solving

208
00:10:43,216 --> 00:10:45,466
the problem and now I am on my way.

209
00:10:45,483 --> 00:10:48,466
>> Yeah, you know you might say, "Well, why do I need to do that?"

210
00:10:49,483 --> 00:10:52,466
And the answer is because every body's scenario is different.

211
00:10:52,483 --> 00:10:57,166
We were talking in the car last night about how in exchange the

212
00:10:57,483 --> 00:11:00,300
gooey . I mean honestly we spend a lot of time talking to customers

213
00:11:00,383 --> 00:11:03,316
and trying to understand the scenarios and put that into the

214
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:06,466
gooey's that just click, click, click, but the reality is and

215
00:11:06,233 --> 00:11:08,466
Jason was telling me this story, that hey I did that, but then

216
00:11:08,483 --> 00:11:11,466
what I needed to do was I needed to have different quotas for

217
00:11:11,483 --> 00:11:14,466
these types of users verses those types users verses those types

218
00:11:14,483 --> 00:11:19,466
of users and the gooey didn't help me. I had to go do a ton

219
00:11:20,333 --> 00:11:22,466
of clicking. So we might have gone and said, "Oh, okay we will

220
00:11:22,483 --> 00:11:25,466
add that to the gooey", but then all of a sudden if you try and

221
00:11:25,483 --> 00:11:28,466
deal with every bodies scenarios in the gooey it becomes big,

222
00:11:28,483 --> 00:11:32,466
complex and hideous and then you can't use the gooey.

223
00:11:32,483 --> 00:11:37,466
>> And I think that's one of the biggest issues will start to

224
00:11:37,483 --> 00:11:42,466
see at first. There is nothing wrong with using a graphical interface.

225
00:11:42,483 --> 00:11:46,216
I mean sometimes I use it too and I use it for things I just

226
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:50,400
need to do once, one off, once every blue moon. You know, creating

227
00:11:50,483 --> 00:11:52,466
a site link in active directory. The graphical is great for

228
00:11:53,483 --> 00:11:56,466
that, but when you have business challenges that can't be met,

229
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:59,466
such as, and I think what we were talking about last night was

230
00:11:59,233 --> 00:12:03,466
I needed to set the mailbox limits of a particular OU in active directory.

231
00:12:03,483 --> 00:12:07,466
Well the graphical doesn't support that and I don't expect Microsoft

232
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:10,266
to solve that problem for me because how are they supposed to

233
00:12:10,350 --> 00:12:13,466
know what my issues are? PowerShell is a way that you can solve

234
00:12:13,483 --> 00:12:17,250
those issues and that you can get these business problems solved

235
00:12:17,333 --> 00:12:20,416
and it doesn't take six months. You get them solved right now

236
00:12:20,483 --> 00:12:23,466
and then you automate them. So the purpose to PowerShell really

237
00:12:23,483 --> 00:12:27,466
is all about making you more effective getting stuff done faster

238
00:12:27,483 --> 00:12:32,466
and solving problems that you probably had a hard time solving before.

239
00:12:32,483 --> 00:12:34,466
>> Right, because often they are unique.

240
00:12:34,483 --> 00:12:38,466
>> Yeah, very unique. So let's see here: installing PowerShell.

241
00:12:38,483 --> 00:12:41,466
So right now there is a lot of, it's kind of confusing for a

242
00:12:41,483 --> 00:12:44,466
lot of folks. First of all let's talk about some of the versions

243
00:12:44,483 --> 00:12:47,466
of PowerShell. Nobody should have V1 right now, right.

244
00:12:48,483 --> 00:12:49,466
>> You should upgrade V1.

245
00:12:51,483 --> 00:12:55,466
>> So V2 came out a couple of years ago and

246
00:12:57,216 --> 00:13:01,466
you should have V2 on Windows 7 and you should have it on 2008,

247
00:13:01,233 --> 00:13:05,466
2008 R2 and V2 also works and is part of the update stream that

248
00:13:06,0 --> 00:13:09,466
you can update for Windows XP, and shame on you if you still

249
00:13:09,483 --> 00:13:13,0
have Windows XP and of course Server 2003.

250
00:13:13,483 --> 00:13:19,383
Now V3 is the new one and V3 came out for Windows 2008 and for

251
00:13:19,466 --> 00:13:24,466
Server 2012. If at all possible as the administrator you want

252
00:13:24,483 --> 00:13:27,400
V3 on your box and you are going to see plenty of examples of

253
00:13:27,483 --> 00:13:29,466
that today, of needing to have V3.

254
00:13:30,483 --> 00:13:33,466
You can upgrade V3 and have that on your box for both

255
00:13:36,483 --> 00:13:40,466
Windows 7 and Server 2008 R2 and that's it though, right?

256
00:13:40,483 --> 00:13:44,333
>> Windows Server 2008 and 2008 R2.

257
00:13:44,483 --> 00:13:47,466
>> And 2008 RN, I have got to make sure I get them all in there.

258
00:13:47,483 --> 00:13:50,466
So you can upgrade to V3. Now you don't have to rush out right

259
00:13:50,483 --> 00:13:54,433
now and start upgrading your servers to V3 and you should take

260
00:13:54,483 --> 00:13:56,466
some cautions out there. There are some products that aren't

261
00:13:56,483 --> 00:13:59,466
quite ready to handle V3 and there is plenty of information on that.

262
00:13:59,483 --> 00:14:03,466
So don't be that guy or gal that makes that mistake and accidentally

263
00:14:03,483 --> 00:14:08,0
upgrades a server to V3 if the product running on it is not ready

264
00:14:08,483 --> 00:14:11,466
for it, but on your administrative machine you have got to have V3.

265
00:14:11,483 --> 00:14:13,466
You are going to love the features we show you today with it.

266
00:14:13,483 --> 00:14:15,466
>> Yeah, you should always read the release notes. We tell you

267
00:14:15,483 --> 00:14:19,466
what it works with, you know, like if you have this don't install that.

268
00:14:19,483 --> 00:14:23,466
>> Yeah, release notes are really good along with testing is also

269
00:14:23,483 --> 00:14:26,466
really good as well. If you take a look at the slide real quick

270
00:14:27,483 --> 00:14:28,466
you will see that there is a place where you can download.

271
00:14:28,483 --> 00:14:31,466
It's a strange name to download PowerShell 3; it's called the

272
00:14:31,483 --> 00:14:34,216
Windows Management Framework. We are going to talk a lot more

273
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:37,466
about what the term the Windows Management Framework means.

274
00:14:37,233 --> 00:14:40,466
It's not just PowerShell and there is a link there for you so

275
00:14:40,483 --> 00:14:43,466
that you can get it downloaded. Now today if you have V2 on your

276
00:14:43,483 --> 00:14:46,466
laptop you will be fine, but probably during lunch you are going

277
00:14:46,483 --> 00:14:49,466
to want to use V3. And just to let you guys know so that we can

278
00:14:49,483 --> 00:14:53,466
get the confusion out of the way what we are doing today is how

279
00:14:53,483 --> 00:14:56,166
to use PowerShell. What we show you how to use today is going

280
00:14:56,250 --> 00:15:01,466
to work on V2, V3 and that mythical thing that's coming out sometime

281
00:15:01,483 --> 00:15:07,466
in the future V4ish like stuff. So you are going to be just fine

282
00:15:07,483 --> 00:15:09,466
with whatever version you have.

283
00:15:10,483 --> 00:15:12,466
It's all going to be about the tool today.

284
00:15:12,483 --> 00:15:17,266
Well, let's talk about launching PowerShell. How do you find

285
00:15:17,350 --> 00:15:19,466
PowerShell to launch it? And guys I am actually going to demonstrate

286
00:15:19,483 --> 00:15:21,466
this off of my box real quick.

287
00:15:22,483 --> 00:15:25,466
One of the most interesting things here is if you are on Windows

288
00:15:25,483 --> 00:15:30,166
8 you have this magnificent Windows key that brings up your desktop

289
00:15:30,250 --> 00:15:33,466
for you. And to find PowerShell it's actually very simple.

290
00:15:33,483 --> 00:15:38,466
Just start typing the word PowerShell. Now I have to tell you

291
00:15:38,483 --> 00:15:42,466
the first thing I always do is right click and pin this to my

292
00:15:42,483 --> 00:15:43,466
task bar.

293
00:15:43,183 --> 00:15:43,466
>> I do too.

294
00:15:44,483 --> 00:15:49,466
>> You are going to have PowerShell open more then anything else

295
00:15:49,166 --> 00:15:51,466
that you work with. So you want to make sure you right click

296
00:15:51,483 --> 00:15:55,233
and get this guy pinned. I have already got mine pinned down

297
00:15:55,316 --> 00:15:58,466
here on my desktop so that you can see it. Now if you are working

298
00:15:59,483 --> 00:16:05,466
with a pre-Windows 8 operating system you are going to have to

299
00:16:05,483 --> 00:16:08,466
click on the start menus. And I have got a screen shot of what

300
00:16:08,483 --> 00:16:10,466
that looks like here in the slides.

301
00:16:11,333 --> 00:16:13,333
You will click on the start menu, as soon as I can figure out

302
00:16:13,416 --> 00:16:15,466
how to bring the slide back up, and it's this guy over here.

303
00:16:15,483 --> 00:16:18,466
You are going to go under accessories and then Windows PowerShell

304
00:16:18,483 --> 00:16:21,466
will be at the bottom. And you are going to notice that there

305
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:23,466
are two kinds of them out here. You are going to see some repeats,

306
00:16:23,483 --> 00:16:26,283
X86 verses ones that aren't X86.

307
00:16:27,316 --> 00:16:29,466
The X86 are obviously the 32 bit versions. You don't want to

308
00:16:29,483 --> 00:16:34,466
run those; you want to run the 64 bit version on your 64 bit OS.

309
00:16:34,483 --> 00:16:37,183
And we will talk a little bit later about the ISE, but this is

310
00:16:37,266 --> 00:16:41,466
a great scripting editor that we can use as well. So as long

311
00:16:41,483 --> 00:16:45,466
as you have got PowerShell to go we are ready to start to work

312
00:16:45,483 --> 00:16:46,333
with it.

313
00:16:46,483 --> 00:16:47,466
>> Rock and roll baby.

314
00:16:47,483 --> 00:16:50,383
>> Now, let's talk a second about comfort.

315
00:16:51,483 --> 00:16:54,466
Comfort is important like these chairs right here this studio

316
00:16:55,483 --> 00:16:58,400
are very, very comfortable and that's very nice. We are going

317
00:16:58,483 --> 00:17:00,466
to spend a lot of time, and I am rocking back and forth because

318
00:17:01,166 --> 00:17:01,466
they are so comfortable.

319
00:17:01,483 --> 00:17:02,466
>> Swaying.

320
00:17:02,483 --> 00:17:07,466
>> Swaying. We are going to spend a lot of time looking at this console.

321
00:17:07,483 --> 00:17:12,466
And PowerShell uses, does it use every possible character on

322
00:17:12,483 --> 00:17:13,466
the keyboard?

323
00:17:13,483 --> 00:17:16,466
>> No actually there is the up arrow.

324
00:17:16,483 --> 00:17:20,466
>> Great, it's the up arrow that we don't use.

325
00:17:20,483 --> 00:17:23,466
Oh, that's awesome. Well guys this is what I am talking about.

326
00:17:24,350 --> 00:17:26,466
First of all let me launch PowerShell and show this to you.

327
00:17:26,483 --> 00:17:29,300
Now I am going to launch it. I am logged in as a regular user

328
00:17:29,383 --> 00:17:31,466
account and I want you to notice that when I launch PowerShell

329
00:17:31,483 --> 00:17:33,466
the first thing is you take a look at the top of the screen here,

330
00:17:33,483 --> 00:17:36,466
see how it says Windows PowerShell? If you want to do some administration

331
00:17:36,483 --> 00:17:39,466
that's not what you want it to say. So let me close this and

332
00:17:39,483 --> 00:17:42,383
show you if you are in as a regular user. You want to right

333
00:17:42,466 --> 00:17:44,466
click and do run as administrator. If you are an administrator

334
00:17:45,166 --> 00:17:48,466
it will already launch it with administrator. If not it will

335
00:17:48,483 --> 00:17:51,466
prompt you for credentials so that you can have administrative access.

336
00:17:52,483 --> 00:17:54,466
We are going to talk about security later, but this is actually

337
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:57,466
an important thing. Notice as I am looking at the console right

338
00:17:57,483 --> 00:18:00,466
now this is something that we are going to be staring at for

339
00:18:00,483 --> 00:18:04,250
a long time. So there are a couple of things that you definitely

340
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:06,333
want to be able to tell the difference in.

341
00:18:06,416 --> 00:18:09,466
>> By the way, one of the tricks that is if you are trying to

342
00:18:09,483 --> 00:18:12,466
do something and it's not working, like this morning, I was trying

343
00:18:12,483 --> 00:18:18,466
to set some things up and I did get VM and it showed me nothing.

344
00:18:18,233 --> 00:18:22,466
I was like, "Oh do I have the wrong machine"? I recently provisioned

345
00:18:22,483 --> 00:18:25,466
it, did I like forget to set things up? And then I looked and

346
00:18:25,483 --> 00:18:29,466
saw that I wasn't in admin mode. So then I bring it up in admin

347
00:18:29,483 --> 00:18:32,466
mode and I say, "Get VM" and you see all your VM's. So if something

348
00:18:32,483 --> 00:18:36,433
is going a little wonky go check and see that you are running

349
00:18:36,450 --> 00:18:36,466
as admin.

350
00:18:37,483 --> 00:18:39,383
>> And I just have to say that we are going to be doing several

351
00:18:39,466 --> 00:18:42,466
things today and out of those things that we are doing today

352
00:18:42,483 --> 00:18:45,466
if you are not in administrative mode it isn't going to work.

353
00:18:45,483 --> 00:18:48,466
It's going to be very wonky. You are going to get error messages,

354
00:18:48,483 --> 00:18:52,166
access denied messages and so you want to make sure you are in

355
00:18:52,483 --> 00:18:55,466
as administrator mode. Take a look at the characters that I have

356
00:18:55,483 --> 00:18:57,466
on the screen. Can you see the difference on your screen what

357
00:18:58,166 --> 00:18:59,433
those characters are?

358
00:18:59,450 --> 00:18:59,466
>> You zoom it.

359
00:19:00,483 --> 00:19:03,466
>> Well no, I want them to look at it and say, "I can't tell the difference".

360
00:19:04,483 --> 00:19:06,466
I want them to go, "No, I don't know what it is".

361
00:19:06,183 --> 00:19:06,466
>> Don't use zoom it.

362
00:19:06,483 --> 00:19:10,283
>> Yeah, don't use zoom it then. This is important, you need to

363
00:19:10,366 --> 00:19:13,466
make sure that this screen you can see these individual characters.

364
00:19:13,483 --> 00:19:17,466
I have got a grave character or a back tick character and then

365
00:19:17,483 --> 00:19:20,466
a single quote. And there are only a couple of pixels in difference.

366
00:19:20,483 --> 00:19:23,166
So here is actually one of the most important things to do when

367
00:19:23,483 --> 00:19:25,466
you are getting ready to use PowerShell. I am going to go in

368
00:19:25,483 --> 00:19:28,466
here to the properties and we are going to adjust this console.

369
00:19:28,483 --> 00:19:31,466
Now I am not going to change mine because that will change all

370
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:34,350
the views up, but let me kind of show you the idea here.

371
00:19:34,433 --> 00:19:39,466
Under fonts you want to use a font that is nice, bold and thick

372
00:19:39,483 --> 00:19:43,466
and they gave you one called Lucida console. Did I say that right?

373
00:19:43,483 --> 00:19:44,466
>> I don't know.

374
00:19:44,483 --> 00:19:47,466
>> I have no idea, console .

375
00:19:47,483 --> 00:19:50,300
>> I say Lucida, never mind.

376
00:19:50,383 --> 00:19:54,166
>> That's okay. Console is a nice font but its thinner. I prefer

377
00:19:54,250 --> 00:19:56,466
the heavier weight font and then you want to adjust the font

378
00:19:56,483 --> 00:20:00,466
size, but when you do that to get it to a nice font size you

379
00:20:00,483 --> 00:20:03,466
are going to notice that in this preview paint that the pretty

380
00:20:03,483 --> 00:20:07,466
PowerShell window is going to extend to the right and go to the bottom.

381
00:20:07,483 --> 00:20:10,266
And these are all bad things and let me tell you why. When PowerShell

382
00:20:10,350 --> 00:20:14,233
is giving you information it wants to sometimes put information

383
00:20:14,316 --> 00:20:17,416
all the way to the right and all the way to the bottom. So if

384
00:20:17,483 --> 00:20:21,466
your screen has extended beyond the boundaries of your desktop

385
00:20:21,483 --> 00:20:23,466
you are not going to see anything.

386
00:20:24,483 --> 00:20:27,416
And you don't want scroll bars all over the place. So let me

387
00:20:27,483 --> 00:20:28,466
show you how to fix that.

388
00:20:28,483 --> 00:20:30,466
>> Oh, you don't use bold? I always use bold.

389
00:20:30,483 --> 00:20:31,300
>> Do you use bold?

390
00:20:31,383 --> 00:20:32,0
>> Always.

391
00:20:32,450 --> 00:20:32,466
>> Really?

392
00:20:32,483 --> 00:20:33,466
>> Yeah.

393
00:20:33,483 --> 00:20:36,466
>> That scares me because it feels like you are yelling at me

394
00:20:36,216 --> 00:20:37,166
or something.

395
00:20:37,483 --> 00:20:38,466
>> Oh, okay.

396
00:20:38,216 --> 00:20:40,333
>> Well, do you want to turn bold on?

397
00:20:40,450 --> 00:20:40,466
>> I always do.

398
00:20:40,483 --> 00:20:41,466
>> Okay, we will turn bold on.

399
00:20:41,483 --> 00:20:44,466
>> I find, well here's the deal, when you present, if any of you

400
00:20:44,483 --> 00:20:49,416
every present to the audience always use bold because it's just

401
00:20:49,483 --> 00:20:51,466
easier to read a couple of hundred feet away.

402
00:20:51,483 --> 00:20:52,466
>> Well it screwed up my desktop. I don't want to turn it on

403
00:20:52,483 --> 00:20:54,466
now, so there.

404
00:20:54,483 --> 00:20:55,233
>> Okay.

405
00:20:55,316 --> 00:20:59,466
>> Now in layout, layout is where you are going to adjust screen

406
00:20:59,483 --> 00:21:03,466
width so that it fits. And then what you want to do is fit just

407
00:21:03,483 --> 00:21:05,466
like this in the preview window. Let me show you two things:

408
00:21:06,483 --> 00:21:09,316
the windows size for width is right here and that will adjust

409
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:12,466
its width. And I will screw mine up for a second and see how

410
00:21:12,483 --> 00:21:15,466
it's kind of going off to the right over there. You don't want

411
00:21:15,483 --> 00:21:18,466
that, you want your width so that it fits so that you don't have

412
00:21:18,483 --> 00:21:21,466
a horizontal. I think that's this way, horizontal scroll bar.

413
00:21:21,483 --> 00:21:25,466
When you adjust the window width size you also want to make sure

414
00:21:25,483 --> 00:21:28,466
you keep the buffer size. You don't want things going off into

415
00:21:28,483 --> 00:21:31,166
the buffer where you will never be able to see it. Height is

416
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:33,466
an important one as well. I want you to notice as I scroll up

417
00:21:33,483 --> 00:21:37,466
and down this height what I don't want to do is scroll that all

418
00:21:37,483 --> 00:21:40,466
the way below my desktop, because then when you see data it will

419
00:21:40,483 --> 00:21:44,466
get put down at the very bottom and you won't see it. So I want

420
00:21:44,483 --> 00:21:47,466
it to fit on my desktop. A vertical scroll bar you have will

421
00:21:47,483 --> 00:21:51,466
be okay. Make sure that for the height buffer size you get at

422
00:21:51,483 --> 00:21:54,466
least 3000 or greater. And I want to warn you that when you are

423
00:21:54,483 --> 00:21:57,466
working with some products that have a PowerShell console that

424
00:21:58,483 --> 00:22:01,333
console is set to 300 by default. So you definitely want to

425
00:22:01,416 --> 00:22:03,466
change that or you are going to lose information and not be able

426
00:22:03,483 --> 00:22:08,466
to scroll back and see it. When it comes to colors . Oh dude,

427
00:22:08,483 --> 00:22:10,466
I am not changing the colors because I like the color scheme

428
00:22:10,483 --> 00:22:11,466
you picked out.

429
00:22:12,483 --> 00:22:13,466
>> Oh, good.

430
00:22:13,483 --> 00:22:16,466
>> But if you want to change the colors to something that you

431
00:22:16,483 --> 00:22:20,466
like to read, you want to make it green screen, whatever or come

432
00:22:20,483 --> 00:22:23,466
up with some weird color combination knock yourself out, but

433
00:22:23,483 --> 00:22:25,466
I am going to leave it at the default color size.

434
00:22:25,483 --> 00:22:27,383
>> Yellow is good.

435
00:22:27,466 --> 00:22:29,466
>> Yeah I know, I thought the yellow would look great. The important

436
00:22:29,483 --> 00:22:34,466
thing is that your console is now ready to go, it's all set up

437
00:22:34,483 --> 00:22:38,0
and it's in a comfortable font. So now while we move on take

438
00:22:38,483 --> 00:22:41,466
a second and make sure you have got a nice looking PowerShell

439
00:22:41,483 --> 00:22:43,250
console to take a look at.

440
00:22:44,483 --> 00:22:46,466
So let's see what we are doing next here. I think we are ready

441
00:22:46,483 --> 00:22:48,466
to get into some demonstration stuff.

442
00:22:50,216 --> 00:22:52,466
Oh, yeah, look, look.

443
00:22:55,483 --> 00:22:56,466
>> Oh man that's old.

444
00:22:56,483 --> 00:22:59,466
>> You have got this mild mustache going. This is great, get

445
00:22:59,483 --> 00:23:01,466
PowerShell, this is awesome.

446
00:23:01,483 --> 00:23:05,466
So let's talk a little bit and start of by taking some of the

447
00:23:05,483 --> 00:23:09,466
fear out of PowerShell. So, before we talk about this magic word

448
00:23:10,483 --> 00:23:16,466
cmdlet you needed to come up with your own commands. Not the

449
00:23:16,483 --> 00:23:22,466
Windows native ones, you needed your own commands. Why the term cmdlet?

450
00:23:22,483 --> 00:23:25,466
>> So there are two answers to that. So the first is that

451
00:23:27,283 --> 00:23:30,466
PowerShell we wanted to have a model of composition, okay.

452
00:23:31,333 --> 00:23:34,333
So the model of composition if you actually take a look at it

453
00:23:34,483 --> 00:23:38,333
the commands that you write are really, really small and the

454
00:23:38,483 --> 00:23:43,466
idea is that then you leverage the engine to do common processing.

455
00:23:43,483 --> 00:23:48,300
So if you had each one of the cmdlets try and do big tasks by

456
00:23:48,383 --> 00:23:51,0
themselves, I want to get things, I want process things and I

457
00:23:51,483 --> 00:23:55,466
want to format them, then every developer would be doing things differently.

458
00:23:55,183 --> 00:23:59,466
You know, well I like the term sort and you like the term order

459
00:23:59,483 --> 00:24:03,466
and order by and all that. So we said, "No, no, you write the

460
00:24:03,483 --> 00:24:08,466
things that you and only you can use, do and then leverage the

461
00:24:08,483 --> 00:24:10,166
engine to do everything else".

462
00:24:10,483 --> 00:24:14,466
So these commands got really, really small and that was the whole point.

463
00:24:14,483 --> 00:24:17,466
They are really, really small and you use the pipeline to do

464
00:24:18,0 --> 00:24:23,466
bigger tasks and because of that you get regularity. That is

465
00:24:23,483 --> 00:24:26,466
to say you are going to learn something and then you can use

466
00:24:26,166 --> 00:24:30,466
it over and over again. So that's where the term cmdlet came from.

467
00:24:30,483 --> 00:24:34,266
But then when we went to bring it out the documentation people

468
00:24:34,350 --> 00:24:37,466
said, "No way, you can't do that, we don't make up terms.

469
00:24:37,483 --> 00:24:40,466
It's called command". It was like, "Well no, we are going to

470
00:24:40,483 --> 00:24:42,466
call it cmdlet". And then it just went to the mat and was like,

471
00:24:42,483 --> 00:24:45,466
"No, no, no, no". And so I said, "I will tell you what bring

472
00:24:45,483 --> 00:24:48,466
up a search window" and they said, "Huh" and I said, "Search

473
00:24:48,483 --> 00:24:52,466
for command". And there was like X hundred million things.

474
00:24:52,483 --> 00:24:56,216
And I said, "Now search for cmdlet" and it was X thousand.

475
00:24:56,300 --> 00:24:59,166
I said, "Every single one of those is related to PowerShell"

476
00:24:59,483 --> 00:25:01,466
and they were like, "Oh, search engine optimization".

477
00:25:01,483 --> 00:25:05,433
>> There you go, a little SCO on using the term cmdlet.

478
00:25:05,450 --> 00:25:05,466
>> Exactly.

479
00:25:06,0 --> 00:25:09,466
>> And I just have to say that my wife refers to them as cmdlets

480
00:25:09,483 --> 00:25:13,466
because that's the way they are spelled, but at any rate cmdlets.

481
00:25:13,483 --> 00:25:18,466
Now how a cmdlet looks is also kind of bazaar if you have never

482
00:25:18,483 --> 00:25:21,466
been at the command line. I mean if you have been at the command

483
00:25:21,483 --> 00:25:25,466
line you see DIR, but now you are seeing these verbs and we have

484
00:25:25,483 --> 00:25:29,466
got this dash and we have got this noun. Why did you sort of

485
00:25:29,483 --> 00:25:30,166
name it that way?

486
00:25:30,483 --> 00:25:31,266
>> Yeah, a lot of people take a look at PowerShell and they say,

487
00:25:31,350 --> 00:25:34,466
"Oh, it looks very much like UNIX" and by the way just so you

488
00:25:34,483 --> 00:25:38,466
know we actually tried to use UNIX. We didn't start of wanting

489
00:25:39,333 --> 00:25:41,466
to invent something. We started off saying, "I have got to solve

490
00:25:41,483 --> 00:25:44,466
a customer problem". So there were some really great tools out

491
00:25:45,333 --> 00:25:47,466
there, the UNIX tools. So my first effort was to get those tools

492
00:25:47,483 --> 00:25:51,250
available on Windows, but it turned out that didn't work and

493
00:25:51,333 --> 00:25:55,466
the reason why is because UNIX is very much a document oriented

494
00:25:55,483 --> 00:25:58,466
operating system, which is to say that a lot of the management

495
00:25:58,483 --> 00:26:03,466
is done through document or files whereas Windows is an API oriented

496
00:26:04,483 --> 00:26:07,466
operating system, okay. Now both have their advantages, but here's

497
00:26:08,483 --> 00:26:11,466
the thing the management is completely different. So when I

498
00:26:11,483 --> 00:26:16,466
got BASH, and AWK, and SED and GREP available on Windows it didn't

499
00:26:16,483 --> 00:26:21,466
help that much, why? Then you go and say AWK, AWK doesn't work

500
00:26:21,483 --> 00:26:25,200
against the registry, and GREP doesn't work against WMI and SED

501
00:26:25,283 --> 00:26:30,466
doesn't work against active directory. So in UNIX those tools,

502
00:26:30,483 --> 00:26:34,466
those text manipulation tools are management tools, but on Windows

503
00:26:35,166 --> 00:26:37,466
they are just text manipulation tools and there is not much text

504
00:26:37,483 --> 00:26:42,466
so it didn't help. So we had to invent our own stuff. So then

505
00:26:42,483 --> 00:26:45,466
the question is . Well we want to invent as little as possible

506
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:51,466
and so we leveraged a lot of the concepts of UNIX, the compositional

507
00:26:51,483 --> 00:26:56,366
model, but UNIX, love UNIX, you guys did a great job, but on

508
00:26:56,450 --> 00:26:59,466
the other hand it has weaknesses as well. And this is an area

509
00:26:59,483 --> 00:27:05,233
where we looked more to VMS DCL or the AS400. They have very

510
00:27:05,316 --> 00:27:08,466
good production oriented environments and they were extraordinarily

511
00:27:09,166 --> 00:27:13,466
regular in their environments, which is to day you had verb-noun

512
00:27:13,483 --> 00:27:18,466
and then this well defined set of parameters. And what happened,

513
00:27:19,333 --> 00:27:22,466
the first time I learned it, I was a UNIX guy for a long time

514
00:27:22,483 --> 00:27:26,466
and then I had to do VMS and I got on and was like, "I hate this

515
00:27:26,483 --> 00:27:30,466
thing, I despise this thing, It's a piece of junk". And I would

516
00:27:30,483 --> 00:27:32,466
go around telling everyone this and then it was like, okay, but

517
00:27:32,483 --> 00:27:34,466
I have got to do it for my job. And I would try some more and

518
00:27:34,483 --> 00:27:38,466
it was just that I hated it and at some point I had to just sit

519
00:27:38,483 --> 00:27:42,466
myself down and said, "Put your big boy pants on Jeffrey, you

520
00:27:42,483 --> 00:27:46,466
have got to learn this" and so it was like okay, stop, get out

521
00:27:46,183 --> 00:27:49,466
of your head condemning things and just like experience it.

522
00:27:49,483 --> 00:27:52,466
And so about an hour later I am like, "Hey, you know, this thing

523
00:27:52,483 --> 00:27:55,466
is pretty cool" and then two hours later it was like something

524
00:27:55,483 --> 00:27:58,466
new comes up and having learned a set of things I said, "Boy,

525
00:27:58,483 --> 00:28:01,466
I wonder if that works?" and it worked. So what happened was

526
00:28:01,483 --> 00:28:04,466
you learned this schema, verb-noun or

527
00:28:05,483 --> 00:28:08,466
slashes there, but then it was a schema. You learned it once

528
00:28:08,483 --> 00:28:11,466
and then you were able to do it over and over and over again.

529
00:28:11,483 --> 00:28:15,466
And that was the joke at Deck. At Deck we used to say, "Hey somebody

530
00:28:15,483 --> 00:28:17,466
put a phish finder on the VAX, can you manage it?" and it was

531
00:28:17,483 --> 00:28:21,283
like sure show phish finder, get phish finder/nolog/confirm.

532
00:28:22,466 --> 00:28:25,466
>> And it think that's really, that's the epitome of what's going

533
00:28:25,483 --> 00:28:28,466
to help us all out not only today, but going forward, the fact

534
00:28:28,483 --> 00:28:32,466
that you get used to, "I want to work with X". Well, I know

535
00:28:32,483 --> 00:28:34,466
that I have got these common verbs that I am going to use.

536
00:28:34,483 --> 00:28:36,466
I am going to be able to get this. I am going to be able to

537
00:28:36,483 --> 00:28:39,466
set this, you know, change it. I am going to be able to new,

538
00:28:39,483 --> 00:28:42,466
create something new. And I think that's very important.

539
00:28:42,483 --> 00:28:47,466
And I started out in AS400 and my first, well while I was being

540
00:28:47,483 --> 00:28:51,466
trained there was a problem and my first thing was, "Can't we

541
00:28:51,483 --> 00:28:55,466
just reboot it?" and I thought the operator was going to punch me.

542
00:28:55,483 --> 00:28:56,466
>> He should have.

543
00:28:56,483 --> 00:28:59,466
>> Yeah, he should have. So hey guys let me show you what these

544
00:28:59,483 --> 00:29:01,466
cmdlets are. Take a look at my current directory location.

545
00:29:01,483 --> 00:29:04,466
Now if I was in something like DOS you guys know that I could

546
00:29:04,483 --> 00:29:08,466
do CD:\, but we have cmdlets now. So watch: set-location

547
00:29:10,483 --> 00:29:15,466
C;\, yeah that's cool. Now if I wanted to get something like

548
00:29:15,166 --> 00:29:17,466
a directory listing in DOS you guys know you can do DIR, but

549
00:29:18,483 --> 00:29:21,433
here is the interesting thing we have cmdlets for this. So get-childitem

550
00:29:22,483 --> 00:29:24,466
will get me a directory listing. And if I want to clear this

551
00:29:24,483 --> 00:29:27,166
screen, if this was DOS we would do CLS, but we have a cmdlet

552
00:29:27,250 --> 00:29:28,466
for that called clear-host.

553
00:29:31,483 --> 00:29:33,250
Please tell me that you are not impressed yet.

554
00:29:33,333 --> 00:29:34,166
[Laughter]

555
00:29:34,316 --> 00:29:38,466
We have got the guys in the back there going, "Yeah, that was,

556
00:29:38,216 --> 00:29:41,166
let's start to take the fear out of PowerShell". One of the

557
00:29:41,483 --> 00:29:43,466
things that helped me tremendously, especially when I got started

558
00:29:44,483 --> 00:29:48,466
with PowerShell was that yes there are cmdlets and yes we are

559
00:29:48,483 --> 00:29:51,466
going to show you how to discover and learn and use those cmdlets,

560
00:29:51,483 --> 00:29:54,466
but you can start using PowerShell right now even if you don't

561
00:29:54,483 --> 00:29:57,466
know those cmdlets. Let me show you, this is kind of interesting.

562
00:29:57,483 --> 00:29:59,466
I am going to close my shell and reopen it again.

563
00:30:01,483 --> 00:30:04,466
So if I want to change from this directory location back to the

564
00:30:04,483 --> 00:30:09,466
root of C it worked, if I want to get a directory listing

565
00:30:11,483 --> 00:30:14,466
DIR worked just perfectly, if I want to clear the screen, CLS,

566
00:30:14,483 --> 00:30:18,466
see it's working as I would expect and here's the interesting

567
00:30:18,483 --> 00:30:21,466
thing let's see if I was a UNIX guy how would I get a directory

568
00:30:21,483 --> 00:30:23,466
listing, LS.

569
00:30:24,483 --> 00:30:26,466
How would I clear this screen? Well, clear.

570
00:30:27,483 --> 00:30:33,350
It's doing UNIX stuff and it's doing Windows stuff and it's making

571
00:30:33,433 --> 00:30:36,466
me happy because I can be a Windows guy and I can start using PowerShell.

572
00:30:37,333 --> 00:30:43,216
A UNIX guy can start using PowerShell. My question is why is

573
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:43,466
that working?

574
00:30:43,483 --> 00:30:47,416
>> Yeah, so what we do is we have got a regular experience, right.

575
00:30:47,483 --> 00:30:51,466
So you have got get child item, set location, etc and you can

576
00:30:51,483 --> 00:30:55,466
always use those things. And then what we did was we put personalities

577
00:30:55,483 --> 00:30:58,466
on it, which is to say we knew that UNIX guys would be coming

578
00:30:58,483 --> 00:31:01,466
to this. We knew that DOS guys would be coming to this and so

579
00:31:01,233 --> 00:31:02,466
we have aliases.

580
00:31:02,483 --> 00:31:07,466
So as much as possible we wanted people's first experience to

581
00:31:07,483 --> 00:31:10,466
not be a frustrating one. That they try a set of things and they

582
00:31:10,483 --> 00:31:12,466
just work. PS continues to work.

583
00:31:12,483 --> 00:31:16,166
>> Exactly and think this is one of the interesting things is

584
00:31:16,250 --> 00:31:19,466
that they are aliases. And aliases think of them as sort cuts

585
00:31:19,483 --> 00:31:26,350
to real cmdlets. So we are not using the actual LS command or anything.

586
00:31:26,433 --> 00:31:29,466
It's pointing to a PowerShell cmdlet, but the idea was, and I

587
00:31:29,483 --> 00:31:32,466
love your use of the term personalities, we built personalities

588
00:31:32,483 --> 00:31:35,466
into this. It's that it makes it comfortable for whatever environment

589
00:31:35,483 --> 00:31:38,466
you are coming from so that you can get started right away.

590
00:31:38,483 --> 00:31:40,466
As a matter of fact let me just kind of show you, get-alias

591
00:31:42,483 --> 00:31:45,466
gives you a list of the current aliases. By the way you guys

592
00:31:45,483 --> 00:31:48,466
should print this out and memorize this in the next few minutes

593
00:31:48,483 --> 00:31:52,466
so you have all the aliases. But this is what allows you to start

594
00:31:52,483 --> 00:31:55,466
working and things like making a directory. I can make a directory,

595
00:31:55,483 --> 00:31:59,200
oh boy, see I can go right to work right away. And this starts

596
00:31:59,283 --> 00:32:00,266
to bring us to another .

597
00:32:01,483 --> 00:32:03,466
>> If you were a UNIX guy you would use?

598
00:32:03,483 --> 00:32:04,466
>> mkdir, right.

599
00:32:06,283 --> 00:32:07,350
>> We could give it try.

600
00:32:07,433 --> 00:32:08,466
>> Let's see mkdir Jeffrey.

601
00:32:10,483 --> 00:32:12,466
>> I hope this works.

602
00:32:13,483 --> 00:32:15,466
>> Awesome. [Clapping] It's all that easy.

603
00:32:16,483 --> 00:32:20,350
So basically your normal command line experience you can bring

604
00:32:20,433 --> 00:32:23,466
right to PowerShell, but wait there's more.

605
00:32:23,483 --> 00:32:24,466
[Laughter]

606
00:32:25,483 --> 00:32:26,466
Yes, there's more.

607
00:32:26,483 --> 00:32:28,466
>> You are going to get a Ginsu knife out of this.

608
00:32:28,483 --> 00:32:31,366
>> Even better than a Ginsu knife. Now first of all I just want

609
00:32:31,450 --> 00:32:34,466
to kind of point out that we are going to talk about help extensively,

610
00:32:34,483 --> 00:32:38,466
but if you want to get help you can type help. And if you are

611
00:32:38,483 --> 00:32:41,466
a UNIX person and want to type help you can type MAN. Now personally

612
00:32:41,483 --> 00:32:45,466
I think UNIX is kind of sexist for the whole MAN thing, but in

613
00:32:45,483 --> 00:32:50,183
PowerShell if you want to get a list of aliases you can type

614
00:32:50,266 --> 00:32:54,400
get-alias, but there's an alias for get alias called GAL.

615
00:32:54,483 --> 00:32:56,466
And see this is what makes me so happy is that PowerShell isn't

616
00:32:56,483 --> 00:32:59,466
sexist so you should use this.

617
00:32:59,483 --> 00:33:06,466
Anyway, stupid, so here is where it gets really cool.

618
00:33:08,483 --> 00:33:10,466
Do you know what you can do from PowerShell besides working in

619
00:33:10,483 --> 00:33:13,466
an environment that already kind of feels comfortable? I can

620
00:33:13,483 --> 00:33:18,0
use Windows native commands. I love this.

621
00:33:18,483 --> 00:33:22,283
Ping a computer and it works.

622
00:33:22,483 --> 00:33:23,466
>> Woo hoo.

623
00:33:23,483 --> 00:33:28,466
>> Yeah, woo hoo. I can run notepad and I know everyone is impressed now.

624
00:33:28,483 --> 00:33:31,466
Oh look, calculator and oh hey, you know what I haven't tried

625
00:33:31,483 --> 00:33:35,466
this yet on Windows 8 I should try this. Do we still have MS Paint?

626
00:33:36,483 --> 00:33:38,0
Oh, this is awesome.

627
00:33:38,483 --> 00:33:44,466
Okay, but the point was this, is that you can still use your

628
00:33:44,216 --> 00:33:47,300
Windows native commands in here. You guys are always checking

629
00:33:47,383 --> 00:33:50,466
IP configuration and all that stuff. Don't be that guy or that

630
00:33:51,0 --> 00:33:53,466
gal and I have to tell you, this is one of the funniest things,

631
00:33:53,483 --> 00:33:57,300
I was teaching an advanced scripting class for PowerShell and

632
00:33:57,383 --> 00:33:59,466
this guy, I have know him a long time, was writing a magnificent

633
00:34:00,383 --> 00:34:03,466
tool to go out and do a bunch of things to a couple other computers.

634
00:34:04,466 --> 00:34:06,466
And he is sitting here going, "Oh my script is broken, can you

635
00:34:06,483 --> 00:34:08,200
help me?" and I am like, "Oh, well what's your problem?" and

636
00:34:08,283 --> 00:34:12,466
he says, "Well the script because it's getting those two machines,

637
00:34:12,483 --> 00:34:15,466
but it's not getting anything from that machine". And I looked

638
00:34:15,233 --> 00:34:18,466
at him and I said, "Well first of all don't forget you are an engineer.

639
00:34:18,483 --> 00:34:21,466
What do you usually do if a machine is not responding? How do

640
00:34:21,483 --> 00:34:26,466
you test that?" And he says, "Oh, I will ping it." and I am like,

641
00:34:27,483 --> 00:34:30,466
"Yeah, see if it's even turned on, very good". So he is sitting

642
00:34:30,483 --> 00:34:33,466
at a PowerShell console and do you know what he did?

643
00:34:33,483 --> 00:34:34,166
>> Yes.

644
00:34:34,483 --> 00:34:38,466
>> Start program, accessories, opened up command prompt to type ping.

645
00:34:38,483 --> 00:34:42,466
I literally looked at him and went, "Get out".

646
00:34:42,483 --> 00:34:43,466
[Laughter]

647
00:34:44,483 --> 00:34:49,466
So the idea guys is you have your Windows native commands and

648
00:34:49,483 --> 00:34:53,333
they work the way you expect them to work so you have an environment

649
00:34:53,483 --> 00:34:57,466
to get started in. So between aliases helping you out and between

650
00:34:57,483 --> 00:35:01,366
running Windows native commands the idea is open up PowerShell.

651
00:35:01,450 --> 00:35:03,466
Don't open up the command prompt, open up PowerShell and start

652
00:35:03,483 --> 00:35:06,466
using PowerShell, because you are going to start them learning

653
00:35:06,483 --> 00:35:10,383
the cmdlets, which we are going to do today. But you are going

654
00:35:10,466 --> 00:35:12,466
to start learning the cmdlets and make your learning curve much

655
00:35:12,483 --> 00:35:16,466
easier this way. It was designed for you to do it this way and

656
00:35:16,483 --> 00:35:18,466
so make your life easy and just go ahead and start using it.

657
00:35:18,483 --> 00:35:21,466
And make sure you show your other administrative friends.

658
00:35:21,483 --> 00:35:25,166
Open up the shell and start using it. It's going to work for you.

659
00:35:25,483 --> 00:35:28,466
So at least that's taking a little bit of the fear out of it.

660
00:35:28,483 --> 00:35:29,466
>> Let's hope.

661
00:35:29,483 --> 00:35:36,0
>> So besides having aliases folks we want to do kind of a reminder

662
00:35:36,483 --> 00:35:37,383
for you.

663
00:35:37,450 --> 00:35:37,466
>> Oh wait can you go back?

664
00:35:37,483 --> 00:35:39,216
>> Oh yeah, yeah, I can go back.

665
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:42,466
>> Can I show them something? Okay, go to my screen.

666
00:35:42,483 --> 00:35:45,466
Okay, hoo ha, perfect, let's see.

667
00:35:46,483 --> 00:35:49,466
Okay, so I don't know if you know this, but the aliases we saw,

668
00:35:49,483 --> 00:35:56,466
right, so we saw aliases for gal pwd, right. So there are these

669
00:35:56,166 --> 00:36:01,466
personalities, but if you take a look there are just a ton of

670
00:36:01,233 --> 00:36:02,166
these things.

671
00:36:02,483 --> 00:36:06,466
So you notice like what are they alias to? They are all verb-noun,

672
00:36:06,483 --> 00:36:11,466
verb-noun, yeah, okay, but the aliases are very regular as well.

673
00:36:11,483 --> 00:36:16,466
Okay, so take a look at this: let's say gal g star, okay notice

674
00:36:16,483 --> 00:36:20,466
wild cards. So notice all the G's start with get.

675
00:36:21,483 --> 00:36:24,466
>> You know what I don't think I have actually ever noticed that.

676
00:36:24,483 --> 00:36:27,466
>> Now here's the thing. That's sort of obvious, right.

677
00:36:27,483 --> 00:36:29,466
>> Well apparently not because I .

678
00:36:29,483 --> 00:36:30,466
[Laughter]

679
00:36:30,483 --> 00:36:32,466
>> But, here's the interesting thing look at this one: gsv.

680
00:36:32,483 --> 00:36:38,283
Now let me see if I can get zoom it working here. Look at that,

681
00:36:38,366 --> 00:36:43,200
so get service, gsv. So then the question is well what about

682
00:36:43,283 --> 00:36:45,466
if I did gal star sv?

683
00:36:47,483 --> 00:36:51,266
And look there, so you have got some, but gsv, sasv,

684
00:36:52,483 --> 00:36:58,466
start service, spsv, and stop service. So look at this sasv, okay.

685
00:36:59,483 --> 00:37:04,466
So let's see, I am getting good at this, sasv is start service.

686
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:11,166
So sv for service, let's see gal sa star and look start, start, start.

687
00:37:11,483 --> 00:37:14,466
So it's not always the case, right, sal al for alias, but yeah,

688
00:37:14,483 --> 00:37:22,466
sa jv. So we have even tried to be thoughtful and shematize the

689
00:37:23,483 --> 00:37:24,466
aliases as well.

690
00:37:24,483 --> 00:37:27,466
>> And you have made them easy to search through and this is going

691
00:37:27,483 --> 00:37:30,466
to become really important when we get to start talking about

692
00:37:31,483 --> 00:37:33,466
using the help system which is what we are going to do next,

693
00:37:33,483 --> 00:37:36,466
but you have made them easy to find aliases. And one of the

694
00:37:36,483 --> 00:37:41,466
things guys I want to show you are on to what Jeffrey was showing you.

695
00:37:41,483 --> 00:37:46,466
With those aliases a lot of times, get alias, a lot of times

696
00:37:46,483 --> 00:37:48,466
you are going to have a cmdlet and you are going to want to know

697
00:37:48,483 --> 00:37:52,0
what the alias is for the cmdlet. There is a way to do this

698
00:37:52,483 --> 00:37:54,466
and we are going to explain what parameters are. They alter

699
00:37:54,483 --> 00:37:57,466
the command and there is a parameter called definition. And if

700
00:37:57,483 --> 00:38:02,466
I were to type in a particular cmdlet it will tell me what the

701
00:38:02,483 --> 00:38:04,466
aliases are available for it. Notice in this case there are a

702
00:38:04,483 --> 00:38:08,466
couple of them: ps and gsp for it. So there are a couple of

703
00:38:08,483 --> 00:38:11,466
different ways to find and work with your aliases. I find it

704
00:38:11,483 --> 00:38:13,466
much easier if you just memorize the list. No just kidding,

705
00:38:13,483 --> 00:38:17,366
don't memorize the list. As a matter of fact don't memorize anything,

706
00:38:17,450 --> 00:38:19,333
but we will talk about that more.

707
00:38:19,483 --> 00:38:21,416
>> You are going to talk about that more?

708
00:38:21,483 --> 00:38:23,466
>> We don't want you memorizing stuff. That just takes the pain

709
00:38:23,483 --> 00:38:28,183
out of it. So questions or comments, make sure you are in the

710
00:38:28,266 --> 00:38:30,466
chat rooms and you are asking questions. We are going to be

711
00:38:30,483 --> 00:38:33,466
checking on you guys as we go throughout this to see if you have

712
00:38:33,483 --> 00:38:37,466
any questions. And there will be a recording of this later.

713
00:38:37,483 --> 00:38:40,466
I know a lot of people are asking if there is going to be a recording

714
00:38:40,483 --> 00:38:43,466
of this. Absolutely, and it will be available online with MVA.

715
00:38:43,483 --> 00:38:47,466
And I am going to remind you with this slide often to ask questions

716
00:38:47,483 --> 00:38:48,466
and stuff like that.
